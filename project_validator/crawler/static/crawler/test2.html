has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">Jamie Maynard’s husband, Timothy, abused drugs, and he hit her. In 2012, after four years of marriage, she left him. Jamie and her two small sons moved in with her parents, postal workers who lived west of Columbus, Ohio, in a tidy white house amid soybean fields. Jamie quit her job, at Old Navy, to work as a state-licensed dealer at the Hollywood Casino, which paid much better—nearly three thousand dollars a month, plus benefits. The Columbus press compared the casino’s façade to a “corrections center just waiting for its barbed wire fence to be installed,” but Jamie, who was twenty-three, found the place exciting.</p><div class="consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit--no-failsafe"><div class="consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content"></div></div><p>Gamblers often sought out flamboyant dealers who tapped their tips jar and cried, “Tokes for the folks!” Jamie preferred not to be noticed. She liked working the busiest shift—from eight at night until four in the morning—partly because she was less likely to be left standing alone at a gaming table, feeling exposed.</p><div class="ad ad--in-content"><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"></div></div><p>She became one of the fastest blackjack dealers on the floor, but the countless repetitive motions inflamed a rotator-cuff injury from her days playing high-school softball. A friend gave her a “perc thirty”—a black-market, thirty-milligram version of Percocet, which contains the powerful opioid oxycodone. A quarter of a pill allowed Jamie to work in comfort. It also gave her energy and confidence. Timothy had called her stupid, but in the casino job Jamie realized that she had a talent for what she called “instant math.” As her self-assurance improved, so did her tips. In the spring of 2013, she bought a used Chevy Cobalt, cranberry red. Driving it around, she played Taylor Swift on repeat.</p><p>Jamie began running a high-limits blackjack table with a fifty-dollar buy-in. She felt guilty watching her regulars risk their savings and, in some cases, lose their homes. Taking a whole perc thirty before her shift eased the discomfort of feeling like an accessory to other people’s misfortune.</p><p>In high school, Jamie had smoked marijuana, and at parties someone had always offered pills, including the catastrophically addictive opioid Oxycontin, which <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/purdue-pharma">Purdue Pharma</a> began marketing aggressively in 1996, when she was seven. Mixing an opioid with the sedative Xanax was said to offer a “Cadillac high.” By the time Jamie started at the casino, opioids were more abundant in Ohio than almost anywhere in the United States. According to Drug Enforcement Administration data <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/dea-pain-pill-database/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_21&quot;}" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/dea-pain-pill-database/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_21" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analyzed by the Washington <em>Post</em></a>, between 2006 and 2012 more than four hundred and twenty-five million pills were shipped to residents of Franklin County, which includes Columbus, and nearby Madison County, where Jamie lived.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-1 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>Jamie and Timothy met in 2006, the summer before her senior year. She didn’t realize that Timothy had a drug addiction until he was arrested for stealing. He sobered up in prison. After he was released, Jamie married him. Not long after that, he brought home heroin. Jamie watched him liquefy the dope in a spoon, over the flame from a cigarette lighter, then inject himself with the fluid. The next day, she let Timothy shoot her up: she didn’t want him to leave her. After using heroin for a few months, Jamie stopped; never having heard of withdrawal, she weathered what she assumed was a stomach flu. She had stayed clean all this time—until the perc thirties.</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">Jamie bought her percs from another user, S., a high-school friend whom she began dating around the time she took the casino job. His mom rented a duplex in the Hilltop, Columbus’s worst drug district. A dealer lived several doors down. S.’s mom allowed her son and his friends to use at her place in exchange for dope.</p><p>Perc thirties sold for a dollar per milligram. Jamie’s habit grew to three pills a day—more than six hundred dollars a week. After paying her bills and her parents, Debbie and Frank Barton, for rent and babysitting, Jamie spent the remainder of her salary on pills. One day, when she couldn’t find her next dose, S. suggested heroin as a temporary substitute. (Molecularly, the two drugs are extremely similar.) A hit cost only ten dollars. Jamie prepared the dope on a square of aluminum foil and smoked it. The high lasted all day.</p><p>Her heroin dealer lived in another part of the Hilltop. Back alleys crosscut the district, making properties easy to enter via rear entrances. The dealer instructed Jamie to park in the alley behind the bungalow where he lived with his family. Downstairs, he kept what Jamie thought of as a normal home, with nice sofas and a coffee table; upstairs, he worked out of a “trashed” office. Amid the mess were guns and safes. Jamie noticed that the office always contained “the most random” items. Users would trade a four-hundred-dollar television for a fifty-dollar half gram of heroin. Jamie once paid with a chain saw.</p><p>A dabbler uses to get high; a person with an addiction uses to stay well. A lapse in consumption triggers withdrawal. The muscles cramp. The skin crawls. The legs spasm, especially at night. The insomnia is crushing. There are drenching sweats, rattling chills. One heroin user, in a 2016 F.B.I. documentary, said that during withdrawal people are “crapping on themselves” and “puking on themselves”; another user said, “You’ll do anything to make it stop.” Withdrawal can lead to life-threatening dehydration, and often causes uncontrollable crying and suicidal thoughts. Jamie told me, “You’re <em>scared</em> to be sick.”</p><p>Her arms became skeletal. She stopped doing her hair and makeup. Her sisters—Kim, a paramedic, and Kristin, a nurse—asked their parents to intervene. Jamie refused to go to rehab, for fear of losing her job and her health insurance. Confessing that she used to take heroin with her husband, she told her family that she had got clean before, on her own, and could do it again. The attempt lasted twelve hours. But Jamie fooled everyone by eating more and paying better attention to her appearance.</p><p>She often bought dope on her way to work—the Hollywood Casino was in the Hilltop, on the site of a former General Motors factory. For privacy, she slipped into the rest room of a Taco Bell or smoked in her car, where she stashed fast-food straws and aluminum foil.</p><p>Other users were Jamie’s best source of information and help. “If your dealer wasn’t answering the phone, or if they were going to be an hour and you were sick, you’d find a friend to get it, so that you could use quicker,” she told me. Users knew which dealers cut dope with coffee grounds, and who sold only to regulars. If a friend bought heroin on Jamie’s behalf, she reimbursed him or her, and vice versa. Users might “tax” each other: a few bucks, a pack of Marlboros, gas. It was common and expected to “break off a piece,” for personal use.</p><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed"><figure

name. She knew a guy who knew a girl named Courtney, who, in the spring of 2015, was looking for Xanax and “subs,” or Suboxone, a prescription medication that helps heroin users get clean by averting withdrawal symptoms. The first time that Jamie and Courtney met in person was at a gas station in the Hilltop. Jamie was turning twenty-six; Courtney was twenty-four. Jamie, who had long blond hair and dimples, was athletic and wore sporty clothes; Courtney, who had dark hair and a heart-shaped face, liked bling and bows, and had a horse named Taco. Both women had chosen full-time employment over college, and came from hardworking families in the Columbus suburbs. Courtney had a direct and lively personality, but she never explained to Jamie how she had got into drugs. Occasionally, they spoke, vaguely, about how they hated the direction their lives had taken, and how much they wished they could change.</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><aside class="persistent-aside" style="position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"><div class="ad ad--rail"><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--rail"></div></div></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></aside></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body grid-layout__content"><p>Courtney, whose last name was Penix, worked as a nanny in Worthington Hills, a suburb of Columbus. She had a boyfriend who lived near Dayton; on Facebook, she told her friends that she was in the first stable relationship of her life. Recently, she had begun spending most nights with him, then driving to Columbus for work. She started texting Jamie when she came to town. In early March, she wrote, “Hey i know someone with xanax if u ever have anyone that wants some.” Jamie wasn’t interested.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-2 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>Several days later, Jamie heard from Courtney again: “Hey can u get h.” When Jamie said that she could probably find some, “in an hour or so,” Courtney said, “Damn. U can’t make it sooner?” As they discussed when and where to meet, Courtney said, “I just need to leave my house so my parents don’t question me.” The next night, she told Jamie, “That was some good shit u got.” Jamie asked, “You want more?”</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">Jamie and Courtney traded calls and texts throughout the month. March 20th: Courtney complained about a “bitch” who had asked her for drugs, and then balked after “I told her either she pays me 25 for em or gives me gas money.” March 22nd: Courtney asked Jamie to cover her for Xanax, but she declined. At the end of March, when no one in the Hilltop seemed to have Xanax, Courtney asked about heroin, noting, “Idk if it will help my withdrawals but I can try I guess.”</p><p>In early April, Courtney wanted subs and Xanax but couldn’t leave work. Jamie offered to bring them to her, before reporting to the casino. Courtney gave Jamie her employers’ address, saying, “Just make sure nothing happens please, I have 2 kids here.” Jamie, whose sons were five and three, replied that she would “never put kids in danger.”</p><p>Jamie never stole to support her addiction or smoked when her children were around. She tended to respond to Courtney like a patient older sister. When Courtney nagged her for running late, Jamie didn’t react; when Courtney asked her to leave drugs in an unlocked car, for pickup, she refused. Courtney said that she had recently been robbed at gunpoint, and Jamie worried that she would get herself killed.</p><p>On April 25th, Courtney headed to Columbus for her older sister’s birthday party. Joking that her boyfriend was driving her nuts, she told Jamie, “I’m about to do the rest of these Xanax,” adding that when the pills were gone she’d “be fucked.” Jamie, recognizing Courtney’s fear of withdrawal, replied, “Well worst case scenario I can get you dope and that’ll help.”</p><p>Before Jamie could track anything down, Courtney found her own supply of Xanax. She asked if Jamie wanted some. Jamie said, “No I’m good.”</p><p>April 27, 2015, was a blustery Monday. Courtney asked Jamie for Xanax again. When an hour and a half elapsed, with no response, she requested “150 worth” of heroin “and a rig,” meaning a needle and a syringe.</p><p>Jamie had already planned to use, before her night shift. By 5 <em class="small">p.m.</em>, she was at her dealer’s house, smoking. As the dealer measured out Courtney’s share, Jamie checked in, by text. Courtney told her, “I just tried to get more money from those check loan places and they wouldn’t do it lol.”</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-3 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>“Lmao,” Jamie replied. “I just got you $175 worth plus two rigs so you owe me $180.”</p><p>They agreed to meet outside a Walmart on Hilliard-Rome Road, a corridor dense with fast-food restaurants and big-box chains. At around 5:20 <em class="small">p.m.</em>, Jamie parked next to Courtney’s Dodge Neon, got out, and spent the next two minutes talking with her. When she noticed Courtney slurring her words, she asked her, “Did you just take Xanax?” Combining heroin and Xanax produced the coveted Cadillac high, but every addict knew that the combination was dangerous. Courtney assured Jamie that she hadn’t taken Xanax since the previous night—Jamie believed her when she said, “I’m just sick.”</p><p>Jamie thought about how “livid” she’d be if another user, inches away, withheld the substance that would immediately make her well. She handed over the dope. The next text from Courtney’s phone arrived shortly after eleven o’clock. It said, “Courtney has passed away from an overdose.”</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">At first, Jamie thought that someone was playing a horrible prank, and didn’t respond. The next day, she returned to the Hilltop, and mentioned the text to her dealer. He warned her, “If the police come to talk to you, you’d better not mention <em>me.</em>” Jamie assured him that she wouldn’t. She later told me, “You always hear those stories about people telling who their dealer was, and then their family ends up dead.”</p><p>Jamie spent the summer expecting the police to question her about drugs. But what really anguished her was the thought that Courtney might still be alive were it not for their meeting. No longer concerned with her own life, Jamie spent more and more time high on heroin.</p><p>On August 12th, she had just begun her Wednesday-night shift when a casino security guard pulled her off the floor. Two plainclothes detectives from the Special Investigations Unit of the Franklin County Sheriff’s Office were waiting to question her. Jamie responded to their small talk amiably, and signed a document acknowledging that she understood her legal rights.</p><p>Their initial questions were simple: Where do you live? Are you married? How old are your children?</p><p>Then: How did you know Courtney? Through a mutual friend, Jamie said. The older of the two officers, a sergeant, asked, “Did you ever move any other kind of drugs for him, other than Suboxone?” Jamie said no.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-4 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>“Listen, we’re not here to arrest you for drug trafficking,” the sergeant told her. When was the last time she’d seen Courtney?</p><p>“I got a text message saying she was dead,” Jamie said, adding that she’d seen her that day.</p><p>“Do you remember what you guys did?”</p><p>“She was trying to find drugs.”</p><p>What kind of drugs? “Anything to make her well.” Did Jamie “help her out”? Jamie said that she couldn’t remember.</p><p>The sergeant told her he needed the truth: “We want to know where the dope came from that you gave to her.”</p><inline-embed childTypes="image" name="feature-default"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><picture class="asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="Phil and Susan Penix looking in mirror." class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e333e86f4a3e60008ba8313/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/200210_r35748.jpg" srcSet="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e333e86f4a3e60008ba8313/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/200210_r35748.jpg 1600w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e333e86f4a3e60008ba8313/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/200210_r35748.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e333e86f4a3e60008ba8313/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/200210_r35748.jpg 1024w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e333e86f4a3e60008ba8313/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/200210_r35748.jpg 768w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e333e86f4a3e60008ba8313/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/200210_r35748.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></span></div><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption caption-shade--light"><span class="caption__text">Phil and Susan Penix, whose daughter Courtney took drugs supplied by Maynard, supported Maynard’s prosecution.</span><span class="caption__credit">Photograph by Justine Kurland for The New Yorker</span></figcaption></figure></inline-embed><p>Jamie couldn’t imagine giving up her dealer’s name.

A young woman just like Jamie was dead. Frank and Debbie couldn’t imagine what Courtney’s family was going through, any more than they could fathom the idea of Jamie—who had never been in legal trouble—being held responsible for a homicide.</p><p>Eight days later, when Jamie reported for work, investigators were waiting to arrest her. They confiscated her phone, expecting her texts to match Courtney’s; they swabbed the inside of her mouth, expecting her DNA to align with forensic evidence collected from Courtney’s car.</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="" class="recirc-most-popular-wrapper viewport-monitor-anchor"></div></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body grid-layout__content"><p>After Jamie spent the night in the county jail, her parents bailed her out and took her home. Cut off from heroin, she was soon, as she later told me, “flopping on the floor like a fish.” One of her sisters drove her to the emergency room, and Jamie spent the next few days in hospital detox.</p><p>Jamie and her family met with Mark Collins, a former Franklin County prosecutor who was now a well-known criminal-defense attorney in Columbus. Jamie’s situation infuriated him. More and more, law-enforcement officials and prosecutors were treating fatal overdoses as homicide cases. Overdose deaths were a tragedy, Collins believed, but they weren’t crimes unless the drugs had been given maliciously. What Jamie needed was treatment, not prison.</p><p>Jamie faced a kind of criminal prosecution that takes various forms, depending on the jurisdiction. Such cases have been categorized as “drug-induced homicide,” “murder by overdose,” “drug delivery resulting in death,” and “overdose homicide.” More than two dozen states now have laws allowing prosecutors to bring felony charges against anyone who provides drugs that prove fatal. States without specific legislation, such as Ohio, can indict a supplier under existing statutes: manslaughter, depraved heart, reckless homicide, murder. Potential punishments range from a year in prison to death. According to a recent study by the Northeastern University School of Law’s Health in Justice Action Lab, prosecutors in almost every state have exercised the overdose-homicide option.</p><p>Legal experts have traced these prosecutions to the fatal overdose of Len Bias, a superstar forward at the University of Maryland, who collapsed on June 19, 1986, in his dorm suite. Less than forty-eight hours earlier, he’d been drafted by the Boston Celtics.</p><p>Bias had taken high-quality cocaine, but politicians and the media nevertheless associated his death with the nation’s burgeoning crack epidemic. The Democrats were trying to retake the Senate, and wanted to prove that they could be tough on crime. House Speaker Tip O’Neill urged Congress to craft forceful antidrug legislation that candidates could cite in their reëlection campaigns. Eric Sterling, then the assistant counsel for the House Judiciary Committee, later recalled that lawmakers drafted the legislation without holding a single hearing, adding, “We did not consult with the Bureau of Prisons, or with the federal judiciary, or with D.E.A., or with the Justice Department.”</p><p>That October, Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. It established mandatory minimum prison sentences for a range of narcotics crimes, including a “death resulting” offense involving the sharing or the sale of drugs. Sterling, now the director of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation, which focusses on failed drug policy, has noted that Congress assumed the legislation would lead law-enforcement officials to target “high-level traffickers.” But America’s prisons soon filled with low-level offenders; illicit drug use and trafficking continued unabated.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-6 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>Policymakers and scholars eventually agreed that neither harsh penalties nor the threat of them significantly deters drug use and sales. But in the meantime dozens of states enacted their own versions of the federal law, including the overdose-homicide provision. At first, the option went largely unused: the Northeastern law lab recently <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.healthinjustice.org/drug-induced-homicide&quot;}" href="https://www.healthinjustice.org/drug-induced-homicide" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">attempted to chronicle the history of such cases</a>, and found hardly any from the eighties and nineties. But in the past two decades, as opioid addiction escalated and overdoses became the leading cause of death in America for people under fifty, police officers and prosecutors seized upon the overdose-homicide alternative as a new “tool.” Now there are many hundreds of such cases a year.</p><p>Like the federal law, the state statutes ostensibly targeted “high-level traffickers” and “repeat offenders.” Some career criminals have been caught in this way. Last year, a New Jersey woman fatally overdosed on fentanyl-tainted heroin; police charged the man who purportedly provided her with the drugs, and also Curtis Geathers, the man’s alleged source. Geathers had multiple priors: in the early two-thousands, he was prosecuted for attempted murder and went to prison for aggravated assault; in 2016, he pleaded guilty to trafficking after police found nearly six hundred packets of heroin, plus cash and crack, in his hotel room.</p><p>But, as Northeastern has reported, overdose-homicide prosecutions tend to sweep up minor offenders who are “struggling with addiction and who purchase drugs on behalf of themselves and their peers.” Leo Beletsky, the director of the Northeastern law lab, studied two hundred and sixty-three prosecutions that occurred between 2000 and 2016, and <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3185180&quot;}" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3185180" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a> that about half of the defendants were “friends, family, or romantic partners” of the person who died. In Wisconsin, Daniel Adams, a defense attorney, surveyed a year’s worth of his state’s cases, from 2015, and found that only nineteen of eighty-one defendants were “commercial drug dealers.” In <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;http://defensewisconsin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Grey-Sentencing-Memo-Len-Bias-Homicide.pdf&quot;}" href="http://defensewisconsin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Grey-Sentencing-Memo-Len-Bias-Homicide.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a sentencing memo</a>, Adams defined commercial drug deals as “deliveries that were performed solely for financial benefit—not by another addict/middleman/connection for joint use or to otherwise support their own addiction.”</p><p>Lee Hoffer, a medical anthropologist at Case Western Reserve who studies local heroin markets as “complex adaptive systems,” identifies this subset of users as “brokers.” He has <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.academia.edu/5558998/_Copping_in_Heroin_Markets_The_Hidden_Information_Costs_of_Indirect_Sales_and_Why_They_Matter&quot;}" href="https://www.academia.edu/5558998/_Copping_in_Heroin_Markets_The_Hidden_Information_Costs_of_Indirect_Sales_and_Why_They_Matter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">written</a> that “a buyer trusts the broker to make a purchase and return with drugs; a broker trusts that if they do so the buyer will reward them. In this way, brokering is a ‘favor’ and an economic service.” One prosecutor told me, “Yeah, we call that a drug dealer.” But Hoffer argues that dealers “invest in a quantity of drug to resell,” or they “juggle”—buy illicit substances and repackage them into smaller quantities for resale.</p><p>Crucially, brokers do not profit from their role. Jamie’s finances worsened the entire time she used heroin. Having borrowed against both her paycheck and her car title, she owed creditors thousands of dollars in high-interest loans. She scored some free drugs, helped some people who were also struggling with addiction, and made it through another day without withdrawal.</p><p>No one has formally documented how many Americans are going to prison in overdose-homicide cases, but the nonprofit Drug Policy Alliance found that, between 2011 and 2016, media references to such prosecutions rose by more than three hundred per cent. Northeastern’s study showed that Pennsylvania appears to lead the country; Ohio runs second, with at least three hundred and eighty-five cases in the past two decades. In December, five legal scholars, including Beletsky, asked the Ohio Criminal Sentencing Commission to reassess the state’s use of overdose-homicide prosecutions. In <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/Boards/Sentencing/materials/2019/Dec/AcademicsResponse.pdf&quot;}" href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/Boards/Sentencing/materials/2019/Dec/AcademicsResponse.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one exchange</a> with the commission, the scholars urged accountability that is “proportionate to culpability.”</p><p>The sentences can be outlandish. In 2015 in Louisiana, Jarret McCasland, whose girlfriend fatally overdosed, was found guilty of second-degree murder and automatically sentenced to life in prison without parole. Nearly two thousand people have signed <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.change.org/p/stop-the-injustice-let-s-get-jarret-home&quot;}" href="https://www.change.org/p/stop-the-injustice-let-s-get-jarret-home" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a petition</a> arguing that McCasland is being punished “for being addicted to opiates,” and that the verdict is a “slap in the face to all who seek help from this painful disease.” The judge said that it bothered him “tremendously” that he had to impose a life sentence. McCasland’s appeals attorney later said, “The court was right to be troubled by a law that equates poor judgment with murder.”</p><p>In Florida, in 2017, Jamie Nelson, a drug user, gave another user, Tracy Skornicka, a ride to find Nelson’s dealer, in exchange for several dollars’ worth of heroin. After Skornicka overdosed and died, Nelson was charged with first-degree murder. The state could have put her to death. When Nelson’s lawyer, Jeffrey Leukel, succeeded in getting the murder charge dismissed, prosecutors in Seminole County had Nelson indicted for manslaughter. Leukel told me that, for the prosecutors, “it’s more important to them to save face than to do the right thing.” Nelson, who was also charged with distribution, now faces a possible thirty years in prison.</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"><div class="ad ad--rail"><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--rail"></div></div></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body grid-layout__content"><p>Prosecutors and law-enforcement officials are holding conferences and online seminars to explain how their colleagues could pursue overdose-homicide cases. Defense attorneys, meanwhile, are scrambling to learn how to respond to such prosecutions. Northeastern recently published the second edition of a defense “<a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3265510&quot;}" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3265510" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tool kit</a>,” an eighty-six-page manual inspired both by prosecutors’ increasingly enthusiastic embrace of the approach and by anecdotal reports of ineffective defense counsel. The tool kit advises defense lawyers to scrutinize autopsy reports, death certificates, and toxicology results: many opioid-overdose deaths involve multiple drugs, raising “significant” questions about cause of death. In Pennsylvania, the tool kit notes, some deaths have been reported as overdoses “with no toxicology reports.” One county coroner, after the death of a friend’s son, began classifying all fatal heroin overdoses in his jurisdiction as homicides.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-7 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>Politicians have often been opportunistic in their championing of overdose-homicide law. In his sentencing memo, Adams, the defense attorney in Wisconsin, wrote that many state prosecutors criminalize addiction as a way to “show action” in the face of the opioid scourge. In 2017 alone, legislators in at least thirteen states proposed new laws. That year, a Florida sheriff warned, in a video that went viral on social media, “If our agents can show the nexus between you, the pusher of poison, and the person that overdoses and dies, we will charge you with murder.” The sheriff was flanked by four officers wearing body armor and balaclavas. President Donald Trump, who has called for drug dealers to be put to death, has not directly addressed overdose-homicide cases, but in 2018 Attorney General Jeff Sessions declared that prosecutors “must consider every lawful tool at their disposal”—including the death penalty.</p><p>That year, the National District Attorneys Association, in its first white paper on the opioid crisis, urged law-enforcement agencies and prosecutors to “treat every overdose death as a homicide and assign homicide detectives to respond to these scenes.” The paper’s authors argued that “the potential of being charged with homicide” provided an “added incentive for a dealer to cooperate with law enforcement and provide other actionable intelligence for broader distribution networks.” State prosecutors can exert leverage by threatening defendants with the prospect of federal charges—the mandatory minimum federal sentence for overdose homicide is twenty years. Jared Shapiro, another attorney for Jamie Nelson, in Florida, told me that investigators have the mistaken “impression that they can charge low-level offenders and get them to flip, creating a crumbling pyramid in which El Chapo types will fall.”</p><p>Hoffer, the Case Western anthropologist, said that, as the opioid crisis drags on, the overdose-homicide approach has become “low-hanging fruit.” Collins, the Columbus defense attorney, told me that such prosecutions promote a grotesque misreading of the complexity of addiction; it is obscene, he said, to equate overdose deaths with “hard-core murder cases.”</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">Franklin County, the most populous in Ohio, sits at the center of a state geographically primed for multidirectional trade. Interstates 70 and 71 connect to Denver, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh. Columbus, one of the fastest-growing metropolises in the Midwest, has been called Test City, U.S.A., because so many retail and fast-food companies try out new products there. It’s been said that if you “raked America together you’d find Columbus.”</p><p>In the late nineties, a Mexican drug faction, the Xalisco Boys, identified Franklin County as a promising market for black-tar heroin, which resembles chips of coal. Sam Quinones, the author of the 2015 book “<a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Dreamland-True-Americas-Opiate-Epidemic/dp/1511336404/?tag=thneyo0f-20&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Dreamland-True-Americas-Opiate-Epidemic/dp/1511336404/?tag=thneyo0f-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dreamland</a>,” describes the Xalisco Boys as “our quietest traffickers” and “our most aggressive.” Couriers move in and out of the Columbus area, renting apartments with cash. Testifying at a 2017 congressional hearing, Mike DeWine, who was Ohio’s attorney general at the time and is now the governor, compared buying heroin to ordering a pizza: “You get it in half an hour, and you are going to get it cheap.” After Ohio shut down the pill mills that proliferated with the advent of Oxycontin and other opioids, users found a ready substitute in heroin.</p><div

With heroin, adulterants include the potent painkiller fentanyl and the tranquilizer carfentanil, which is used to sedate elephants. Fentanyl surfaced in the Franklin County drug supply around 2014, and by the next spring Ohio was leading the nation in fatal opioid-related overdoses. Since 2015, more than fifteen thousand Ohioans have died from taking such drugs.</p><p>In March, 2015, Franklin County’s new coroner, Dr. Anahi Ortiz, created a fatality-review board, to scrutinize each unintentional-overdose death in her jurisdiction and identify gaps in the system. She told me, “I brought law enforcement into the room. I brought public health into the room. I brought treatment centers into the room. I brought the public defender into the room.” The reforms led to important improvements, including the increased use of Narcan, an injection or nasal spray that can immediately reverse a heroin overdose.</p><p>Yet Franklin County’s problem kept growing. By April 27, 2015, the day that Jamie and Courtney met in the Walmart parking lot, Ortiz’s office had already handled a hundred and twelve opioid overdoses that year. Users were overdosing at home and in public; two people had drowned (one in a bathtub, the other in a garden pond). A man had overdosed behind the wheel of his Honda Civic while parked outside a Pier 1.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-8 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>One of Ortiz’s close advisers on the review board was Rick Minerd, the chief deputy of the Special Investigations Unit at the sheriff’s office. Minerd, who considers himself “the least coppy cop you’ll ever meet,” has an M.B.A., and prefers innovative problem-solving to car chases. Ortiz’s review board inspired him to find his own creative angle on the overdose epidemic.</p><p>Traditionally, cops have viewed drug users as criminals, and arrested them; the opioid crisis convinced them that drug addiction could happen to anyone, including their own family and friends. Minerd was among those who realized that law enforcement needed to play an aggressive role in outreach and treatment.</p><div class="cne-interlude-embed"></div><p>Congress had directed the Department of Justice and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy to convene a National Heroin Task Force, which ultimately urged “robust criminal enforcement” along with increased access to treatment and recovery services. Opioid task forces multiplied as federal funding became available—the U.S. government is spending billions of dollars on the epidemic. In 2017 and 2018 combined, federal opioid-related programs allocated more than three hundred million dollars to Ohio alone; the Justice Department’s contributions made a particularly dramatic jump, from six million dollars in 2017 to twenty million in 2018.</p><p>In Franklin County, Minerd created a task force called <em class="small">HOPE</em>, for Heroin Overdose Prevention and Education. He assigned two of his top narcotics detectives to work with treatment specialists and provide overdose survivors with access to help. These efforts immediately began saving lives. <em class="small">HOPE</em> detectives are on twenty-four-hour call to drive users to treatment, and they routinely follow up with survivors, urging them to take advantage of free health-care options. As the Northeastern law lab notes, “Numerous cost-benefit analyses have found that treatment outperforms punitive measures; it reduces demand.”</p><p>Another directive of the task force was to treat unintentional fatal overdoses as homicides, with the goal of arresting dealers “capitalizing on people’s addiction.” When Courtney Penix died, the task force was looking for a “test case.”</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="" class="recirc-most-popular-wrapper viewport-monitor-anchor"></div></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body grid-layout__content"><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">Around the time Courtney graduated from high school, an ex-boyfriend texted her parents, Phil and Susan, to say that she had a drug problem. The Penixes had suspected as much. Pain pills and cash often disappeared from their home, along with items that could be hawked, like the family’s PlayStation. The cutlery drawer held a diminishing number of spoons. By the time the Penixes realized the seriousness of Courtney’s addiction, she was eighteen and beyond their legal control. She left rehab early twice. The problem grew so severe that Phil told her, “Your mother and I have already prepared ourselves for your death.”</p><p>After Courtney met Jamie in the Walmart parking lot, she drove across the road, to a Meijer gas station, and entered the rest room. She remained there for more than an hour, with the door locked. A corporate-security manager eventually forced the door open and found Courtney lying unconscious, alongside a used syringe.</p><p>A police officer tried to revive her until paramedics arrived; his partner searched Courtney’s belongings and found a black-rock substance, another syringe, a shoelace, two singed spoons, a lighter, the migraine medication Sumatriptan, and dozens of Suboxone wrappers. Paramedics administered three doses of Narcan, but, at 7:49 <em class="small">p.m</em>., at a Columbus hospital, Courtney was pronounced dead.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-9 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>Homicide detectives from the Columbus Division of Police classified the case as “not a crime.” Later, when Ortiz finalized Courtney’s autopsy, she categorized her death as an accidental overdose.</p><p>The night Courtney died, her parents went through her phone, and found multiple text threads mentioning drugs. Phil told me that he called one of the numbers and “went on a rant” to the man who answered, saying, “If I ever find out who you are, I will make things happen.”</p><p>Three of Courtney’s uncles, on her mother’s side, the Plancks, were police officers. One of them, Brent Planck, a longtime narcotics officer in Columbus, decided to independently investigate Courtney’s death. He told me, “I wanted to find out who was responsible, other than my niece—obviously she’s responsible. But who’s <em>selling</em> this shit?”</p><p>Courtney’s texts provided the name Jamie and an exchange about Walmart. Planck acquired security-camera footage from both Walmart and Meijer. The Meijer footage showed Courtney arriving at the gas station at around 5:40 <em class="small">p.m.</em>, twenty minutes after seeing Jamie, in dark leggings and a white-and-gray windbreaker, her sunglasses on top of her head. The Walmart footage showed a woman getting out of a Chevy Cobalt and meeting Courtney at her car.</p><p>Columbus detectives still did not see a case. But Planck heard that the sheriff’s office was starting an overdose-homicide task force, and handed off his information.</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">When a loved one overdoses, it may be easier for family and friends to think of her as prey than to accept the more complex reality of addiction. And for detectives—who, in conventional homicide cases, often work tirelessly to provide “closure” to grieving families—it can be motivating to reimagine a tragic accident as a crime scene, with a victim and a perpetrator. Dennis Cauchon, the president of Harm Reduction Ohio, a nonprofit that opposes overdose-homicide laws, recalls hearing a prosecutor say at a conference, “When parents ask us to do something, it’s hard to say no.”</p><p>When Ron O’Brien, the chief prosecutor in Franklin County, first heard about the <em class="small">hope</em> task force, he needed to be convinced of the merits of pursuing overdoses as homicides. He viewed such cases as problematic, in part because jurors may be reluctant to hold anyone except the drug user accountable. In a recent Wisconsin case, some prospective jurors declared that they were “uncomfortable” with the idea of prosecuting, given that “the person who died made the decision to take heroin.” In North Carolina, in 2016, Louise Vincent, the mother of a teen-ager who fatally overdosed, initially wanted to “punish” the person who had provided her daughter with drugs. Vincent, who also had an addiction, later decided that overdose-homicide prosecutions were allowing politicians to skirt responsibility for their own failure to curb the opioid crisis. In 2018, Vincent, who directs a nonprofit called the Urban Survivors Union, <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://filtermag.org/the-rage-of-overdose-grief-makes-it-all-too-easy-to-misdirect-blame/&quot;}" href="https://filtermag.org/the-rage-of-overdose-grief-makes-it-all-too-easy-to-misdirect-blame/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">launched #Reframetheblame,</a> a campaign that urges users to sign a “Do not prosecute” document. The “directive” reads, in part, “If I die of an untimely accidental overdose I ask that you do not use my accidental overdose as a tool of your drug war to blame and charge others with murder or homicide.”</p><p>Although O’Brien is a Republican in a city that he describes as “lock-stock-and-barrel Democrat,” he is respected by members of both parties. A lanky, soft-spoken Ohio native, he was elected chief prosecutor in 1996; before that, he served as the city attorney of Columbus. When the sheriff’s office pitched him the idea for the <em class="small">hope</em> task force, he was facing reëlection. Despite his misgivings, he endorsed overdose-homicide prosecutions, having been persuaded that the detectives’ investigation of Jamie Maynard had yielded an “airtight” case.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-10 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>Jamie was indicted in August, 2015. In addition to involuntary manslaughter, she was charged with trafficking, as well as with a lesser-known felony called “corrupting another with drugs,” which, in Ohio, carries a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison. Altogether, Jamie faced up to twenty and a half years. Her parents decided that they couldn’t afford Mark Collins, and instead hired the only lawyer who showed up at the arraignment, Clay Lopez, a former Franklin County prosecutor who was now in private practice.</p><p>Jamie pleaded not guilty. The case became a top story in the local news media. Zach Scott, Franklin County’s sheriff at the time, appeared on TV, declaring that “drug dealers” were now being held to a tough new standard of accountability. Courtney’s parents praised the overdose-homicide initiative; her father said that defendants like Jamie deserved to be charged with murder. Network affiliates aired footage of Jamie at her arraignment, wearing jail khakis and looking unwell. The Ohio media hailed the prosecution, in almost victorious tones: the Fox station in Columbus declared, “Investigators say it can actually be pretty challenging to connect the addict who dies to the dealer who gave them the drugs, but tonight for the first time detectives say they’ve done it—and this is only the beginning.”</p><p>Jamie accepted that she had participated in the drug trade but not that she had “corrupted,” much less killed, Courtney. At the time, an overdose-homicide prosecution was largely untested at trial, and in the end Jamie decided not to risk more than two decades in prison. She pleaded guilty to trafficking and to involuntary manslaughter.</p><p>After her arrest, she had briefly been sober, then relapsed; in the spring of 2016, she got clean again, after learning that she was pregnant. She was dating Jeremy Faust, a plumber and an old high-school friend who was also in recovery.</p><p>Twelve days after their daughter, Joey, was born, Jamie appeared for her sentencing, in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. A family friend spoke for the Penixes, declaring that society should be on “a mission” to “hold street-level dealers accountable and responsible” in fatal overdoses; people like Jamie were “predators” who targeted the “helpless minds of good people.”</p><inline-embed childTypes="image" name="feature-default"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><picture class="asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="Quilt featuring photographs." class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e333e87a157a200083f72ae/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/200210_r35749.jpg" srcSet="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e333e87a157a200083f72ae/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/200210_r35749.jpg 1600w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e333e87a157a200083f72ae/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/200210_r35749.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e333e87a157a200083f72ae/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/200210_r35749.jpg 1024w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e333e87a157a200083f72ae/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/200210_r35749.jpg 768w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e333e87a157a200083f72ae/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/200210_r35749.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></span></div><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption caption-shade--light"><span class="caption__text">A quilt featuring photographs of Courtney Penix hangs outside her parents’ house in Ohio.

Nevertheless, he faulted Jamie for having “provided her the means,” and sentenced her to a term of four years and eleven months.</p><p>Jamie was sent to a women’s prison, in Marysville. Judge Brown had warned her not to apply for early release before she had served at least half of her sentence; she applied, anyway, and he denied her. Last February, Jamie reapplied. During two years in prison, she had become sober, and had committed no infractions. She had earned a community-college degree, making the dean’s list each semester. And she had completed more than a dozen courses on such topics as trauma, grief, relationships, parenting, and victim awareness. In a letter to the court, she wrote, “I am just asking you for a chance.”</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-11 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>The state opposed early release, as did Courtney’s family. At a hearing, her father said, “We’ve got to set an example.” Judge Brown disagreed. He noted that Jamie had largely led “a law-abiding life,” and had committed an offense “under circumstances not likely to recur.” She had “shown genuine remorse” and made “strides toward rehabilitation.” Her “risk of recidivism” was “so low” that he wanted to keep her out of transitional housing, where some offenders live when returning to society. “Placing her with that population of people would actually be detrimental,” he said. On April 25, 2019, Jamie went home.</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">The rate of Franklin County’s unintentional-overdose deaths has climbed since Jamie was indicted: in 2016, there were two hundred and sixty-six opioid-related fatalities. Last year, there were four hundred and twenty-one in just the first nine months. This spring, Franklin County will open a thirty-seven-million-dollar coroner’s facility and, next year, a third jail.</p><p>Since 2015, Franklin County prosecutors have pursued twenty-nine overdose-homicide cases against twenty-seven people. Fourteen of the defendants had a criminal record there, including felony drug trafficking, weapons violations, and robbery involving a firearm. Thirteen defendants, Jamie among them, had no record. Yet the Ohio statute conflates a case like hers with that of a defendant like Rayshon Alexander, who, in 2016, continued to sell carfentanil-tainted heroin even after learning that his customers were “falling out”: two of them died, and at least eleven others suffered near-fatal overdoses. Alexander was charged with murder. He pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter—as Jamie had—and to other felonies, and was sentenced to fifteen years.</p><p>Facing a potentially long prison term, overdose-homicide defendants usually plead guilty. Only two Franklin County cases have gone to trial. One ended in a mistrial. The other involved a defendant, Andrew Nichols, who used cocaine with a young woman he had met in rehab; after she fatally overdosed, he wrapped her body in trash bags and duct tape, and hid it in his basement. His landlord discovered the corpse six weeks later. Nichols was sentenced to six years in prison.</p><p>Overdose-homicide task forces are still being created across the country, consuming enormous resources. According to <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/dpa_drug_induced_homicide_report_0.pdf&quot;}" href="https://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/dpa_drug_induced_homicide_report_0.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Drug Policy Alliance report</a>, this approach is not “successful at either reducing overdose deaths or curtailing the use or sale of illegal drugs.” Beletsky, of the Northeastern law lab, has <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://dc.law.utah.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1219&amp;context=ulr&quot;}" href="https://dc.law.utah.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1219&amp;context=ulr" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">written</a> that the “surging reliance on drug-induced homicide charges” diverts resources from public-health agencies that “already operate in an environment of extreme scarcity.” He pointed out that Narcan is increasingly expensive, and isn’t sufficiently accessible.</p><p>Lindsay LaSalle, who wrote the Alliance report, told me, “We have vested too much discretion in individual prosecutors.” The discretion extends to the very definition of drug dealing. In one Franklin County case, in 2016, prosecutors considered it a “mitigating circumstance” that Lindsay Newkirk, who was charged with involuntary manslaughter after injecting another user with heroin, was the victim’s own daughter. She served two years in prison. Because the relationship was familial, the prosecutors were able to see Newkirk’s actions as something other than drug dealing. O’Brien, the chief prosecutor, told me, “You can sympathize with that offender, because she was herself an addict, her dad was an addict, and she was just trying to help him.”</p><p>O’Brien and I were talking in his office, in downtown Columbus. We were joined by Carol Harmon and Jamie Sacksteder, assistant prosecutors who have handled overdose-homicide cases since O’Brien agreed to formally consider them. I asked how O’Brien’s description of the Newkirks’ dynamic was different from the one between Jamie and Courtney. Jamie, O’Brien said, “was doing it on a regular basis.” He then acknowledged that perhaps Lindsay Newkirk “was, on a regular basis, getting drugs and using them, and giving them to Dad, too—I don’t know.”</p><p>Sacksteder offered that the dad “couldn’t find a vein on his own,” and that his daughter was “basically helping him, so he wouldn’t get dope-sick.” I again noted the similarities to Jamie Maynard’s case. Harmon interjected, “The daughter’s not a dealer.”</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-12 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>At the hearing on Jamie’s early release, Harmon had told the court that she had “re-looked” at the texts between Jamie and Courtney, and still viewed them as proof that Jamie was a dealer. “People would reach out to her” for “a hookup,” Harmon told the judge, adding, “I’m not standing here telling the court that she was some big-kilo amount of drug dealer and mover, but Ms. Penix died on April 27, 2015, and those are the drugs that Ms. Maynard gave her.”</p><p>In O’Brien’s office, Harmon repeated this argument, saying, “We had evidence that Maynard—again, I’m not sitting here saying that—”</p><p>“She’s not the French Connection!” O’Brien said.</p><p>The Northeastern scholars call prosecutors and law-enforcement officials “the most powerful influence” behind the “ethically dubious leap” between overdose and homicide. They argue that such a perversion of legislative intent threatens to “flood the system”: the U.S. homicide rate could spike considerably if more police agencies embrace the strategy.</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">Nate Smith, the sergeant who originally led the <em class="small">hope</em> task force, told me it bothered him that, in the past, “so many people’s son or daughter would die of an overdose, and seldom was a police report even taken.” He and Minerd, both highly decorated law-enforcement officials, felt that they were doing good by treating unintentional overdoses as homicides. Minerd said, “To watch parents who have parented the right way, and who raised their kid in a community they thought was safe and that kid <em>still</em> overdosed? They’re not moral failures. They didn’t parent wrong. That’s always been the motivating factor for me, listening to the stories of the families. The hurt in their eyes—that’s what motivates me.”</p><p>The task force has expanded its scope, and now collaborates with some twenty law-enforcement agencies in Franklin County. Smith recently left <em class="small">hope</em>, in order to teach at the training academy for the Franklin County Sheriff’s Office. A new sergeant, Brian Toth, transferred in, from organized crime. The task force, which works within the sheriff’s undercover narcotics unit, now has four dedicated detectives. On multiple occasions, I joined them, and the wider narcotics team, as they worked various cases. One day, <em class="small">swat</em> operators raided a house and found drugs, cash, and a gun. In another case, detectives met a compromised cartel courier in a trap house; they confiscated heroin that had been sewn into a pink velveteen pillow stitched with “There’s no place like <em class="small">HOME</em>.” In a sting operation, detectives used hidden cameras, and the help of a real-estate agent, to arrest a woman who was accused of posing as a prospective home buyer in order to steal painkillers from people’s medicine cabinets. In an October case, a man was discovered dead, on his aunt’s sofa, surrounded by “Gone with the Wind” memorabilia and still holding the TV remote. Drug paraphernalia was present, but his cell phone offered no immediate leads on where he’d obtained the drugs; detectives inventoried it, anyway, in the hope that further scrutiny would yield clues. In another incident, where three people died in the same house, detectives used a cell phone found at the scene to text the person they believed had delivered the fatal batch, and pretended to order more drugs; they then arrested the guy who showed up with dope.</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="" class="recirc-most-popular-wrapper viewport-monitor-anchor"></div></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body grid-layout__content"><p>One morning in August, Toth responded to a call from an old brown brick apartment building north of Columbus. It resembled a two-story motel, with exterior staircases and iron railings. The referring detective told Toth that a woman and her boyfriend had fallen asleep together the previous night: “She wakes up this morning, about 8 <em class="small">a.m.</em>—he’s fuckin’ <em>dead</em>.” The girlfriend was sitting outside with a neighbor, wearing a pink tie-dyed shirt, black leggings, and Nike slides. Toth, noticing that the woman had uncontrollable jitters, said, “Look at that leg.”</p><p>Upstairs, in Apartment H, the dead man lay face up at the foot of a mattress on the living-room floor. He was bare-chested, and wearing dungarees and dark socks. Foamy vomit had run from the left side of his mouth and down his face. The inside of his left forearm held needle marks.</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-13 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p>The detectives looked around. The apartment was largely empty, but on a dresser they found a charred spoon, scales, baggies, and a razor blade. A heavy stick leaned beside the front door; in one corner was an aluminum bat. There was a deck of cards, a bunch of dice, and a scorecard pencilled with players’ names: Daddy, Baby. Baby was up by one.</p><p>Next to the body lay a pack of Marlboros and a purple lighter. A tiny photograph of a woman was taped to the pack. That’s how personal property is labelled in rehab, one of the detectives pointed out.</p><p>The woman in the photograph wasn’t the girlfriend—it was a neighbor, who was in jail. Toth put the girlfriend in the front seat of his unmarked police vehicle and asked for an explanation. Detective Chuck Clark, whose case it was, sat in the back, listening closely. The girlfriend told the investigators that whatever had killed her boyfriend must have come from elsewhere. She said, “I know he found something in that cigarette pack—I know it! I can feel it in my fucking soul!”</p><p>The detectives hadn’t found anything in the pack except cigarettes. Toth said, “You saw something in that cigarette pack.”</p><p>“I did not!”</p><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><div class="grid grid-items-0 responsive-cartoon asset-embed__responsive-asset"><a class="grid--item responsive-cartoon__image-link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a22923"><picture class="responsive-cartoon__image responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="A man uses a large stack of books for each table leg to stop the table from wobbling." class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5e333e86194cad0009b80550/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/200210_a22923.jpg" srcSet="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5e333e86194cad0009b80550/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/200210_a22923.jpg 1600w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5e333e86194cad0009b80550/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/200210_a22923.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5e333e86194cad0009b80550/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/200210_a22923.jpg 1024w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5e333e86194cad0009b80550/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/200210_a22923.jpg 768w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5e333e86194cad0009b80550/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/200210_a22923.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></a><figcaption class="caption grid--item responsive-cartoon__caption caption-shade--light"><span class="caption__text">“There!

Clark thought for a moment, then said, “Personally, I don’t think she ought to be Code B’d.” With that, the woman escaped Jamie Maynard’s fate.</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">Not long ago, Jamie’s mom asked her, “Would you be alive right now if you had gotten off?” They were sitting in the family room of Frank and Debbie’s house one afternoon. Jamie thought for a minute and said, “Probably not.” She has now been sober for three years.</p><p>Whenever I visited the Bartons, Jamie’s parents always sat together quietly, on their sectional sofa, listening to their daughter describe her life. At one point, Debbie said, “I don’t understand the whole addiction thing, so then I get really mad.” Addiction, in her opinion, was “a choice.” Jamie told her mom, “It literally changes the chemicals in your brain.”</p><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="inline-recirc" class="inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-15 viewport-monitor-anchor"></div><p><a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/soa_2014.pdf&quot;}" href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/soa_2014.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse</a>, addiction is a complex brain disease—“a medical illness,” not a “moral failing.” Northeastern’s Action Lab notes that addiction “alters brain neurochemistry such that it compels a person to satisfy cravings <em>despite recognized negative consequences</em>.” In 2015, both Jamie and Courtney would have suffered “intolerable distress” at the prospect of being unable to use heroin; they were contending with a disease that had diabolically transformed their lives into what the <em class="small">NIDA</em> <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Pocket-Guide-Addiction-Assessment-Treatment/dp/1585625124/?tag=thneyo0f-20&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Pocket-Guide-Addiction-Assessment-Treatment/dp/1585625124/?tag=thneyo0f-20" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calls</a> “a landscape of cues and triggers, like a video-game environment cunningly designed to pose the greatest challenge to his or her willpower at every turn.”</p><p>A twisted distinction of overdose-homicide cases is that many defendants need the same mental-health and addiction treatments that are offered to survivors of an overdose. The laws purport to protect life, but they may actually increase fatalities: a witness to an overdose may be less likely to dial 911, for fear of being prosecuted. Most Good Samaritan laws, which provide immunity to people who call for help, don’t apply to overdose-homicide cases. According to the Northeastern study, the statutes “create a quandary for people calling 911: you (probably) won’t get in trouble if the person experiencing an accidental overdose event survives, but if death occurs, you’re calling the cops on yourself.”</p><p>While Jamie was in prison, her parents took care of her newborn daughter and her sons. (Timothy violated the terms of his parole, and is back in prison.) After she got out, she returned to living with them. She and Jeremy resumed their relationship. Three times a week, they attend an A.A. meeting together.</p><p>Even though Jamie is no longer incarcerated, her punishment, she discovered, has not ended. Her trafficking charge can eventually be expunged, but an F1—a first-degree felony—is for life. Barring a pardon or a special type of appeal, which she cannot afford, she will always be ineligible for certain housing and employment.</p><p>The state revoked her gaming license. Last August, desperate after months of looking for a job, she walked into a temp agency and told a supervisor the whole story. The agency found her a job as a janitor at a factory. Jamie got up at five-thirty every morning to mop floors and clean toilets. She was home by the time her kids got off the school bus. She took weekend and holiday shifts, for the overtime. In October, she received a promotion, to quality control, making $14.50 an hour. She would like a full-fledged job at the plant but has delayed applying, fearing that she’ll fail the company’s mandatory background check.</p><p>Jamie sometimes regrets not allowing her case to go to trial. She wonders if there shouldn’t be a less severe kind of criminal charge for defendants who are not high-level traffickers. She wonders, too, what a jury would have made of Courtney’s autopsy, which revealed that she died not strictly of a heroin overdose but, rather, of a toxic combination of heroin and alprazolam—Xanax. Other substances found in her bloodstream included the sedative lorazepam and the depression medication Trazodone.</p><p>In another case, in nearby Licking County, an appeals court recently overturned a conviction in a case involving a mixture of heroin and cocaine. And last year the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court struck down a conviction because prosecutors failed to prove that the defendant knew that the heroin he’d given a schoolmate would kill him. Because overdoses are often medically ambiguous, defendants might be wise to reject a plea offer and take their cases to trial. Leukel, the Florida attorney, told me, “The hammer of the criminal-justice system carries so much weight, people are accepting responsibility for things they shouldn’t be accepting responsibility for.”</p><p>If more prosecutors began losing such cases, they might stop making overdose-homicide charges against low-level offenders, especially people struggling with drug addiction themselves. This past December, the family of a Franklin County man who died after a friend gave him heroin asked the court not to impose a prison sentence. Such a punishment, they said, would be “the worst possible outcome.” The dead man’s sister told the judge, “It could easily have been the other way around.” ♦</p></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"><div class="ad ad--rail"><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--rail"></div></div></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></div></div></div><div role="none"><div role="none"><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__truncation-message article__body grid-layout__content"><div class="container container--body"><div class="container--body-inner"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article><div class="content-footer"><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><footer class="grid--item content-footer__magazine-disclaimer grid-layout__content">Published in the print edition of the <a href="/magazine/2020/02/10">February 10, 2020</a>, issue<!-- -->, with the headline “A Deadly Mistake.”</footer></div><div class="row"><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="contributors contributors--no-bottom-line grid--item grid-layout__content"><div class="contributor-bio contributor-bio--align-left contributors__contributor-bio"><div class="contributor-bio__responsive-image"><a href="/contributors/paige-williams"><span class="responsive-asset"><picture class="responsive-image"><img alt="" class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b811c7a8e33fb390218/1:1/w_270%2Cc_limit/williams-paige.png" srcSet="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b811c7a8e33fb390218/1:1/w_270%2Cc_limit/williams-paige.png 270w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b811c7a8e33fb390218/1:1/w_270%2Cc_limit/williams-paige.png 270w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b811c7a8e33fb390218/1:1/w_270%2Cc_limit/williams-paige.png 270w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b811c7a8e33fb390218/1:1/w_240%2Cc_limit/williams-paige.png 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b811c7a8e33fb390218/1:1/w_240%2Cc_limit/williams-paige.png 240w" sizes="100vw"/></picture></span></a></div><div class="contributor-bio__content"><div class="contributor-bio__bio"><a href="/contributors/paige-williams">Paige Williams</a> is a staff writer at The New Yorker and the Laventhol/Newsday Visiting Professor at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism.</div><div class="contributor-bio__footer"></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="row has-top-border-content has-bottom-border-content"><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="tag-cloud grid--item content-footer__tag-cloud with-top-border with-bottom-border grid-layout__content"><span class="tag-cloud__section-header">More:</span><a class="tag-cloud__tag-link" href="/tag/addicts"><span class="tag-cloud__tag-name">Addicts</span></a><a class="tag-cloud__tag-link" href="/tag/drugs"><span class="tag-cloud__tag-name">Drugs</span></a><a class="tag-cloud__tag-link" href="/tag/overdoses"><span class="tag-cloud__tag-name">Overdoses</span></a><a class="tag-cloud__tag-link" href="/tag/ohio"><span class="tag-cloud__tag-name">Ohio</span></a><a class="tag-cloud__tag-link" href="/tag/heroin"><span class="tag-cloud__tag-name">Heroin</span></a><a class="tag-cloud__tag-link" href="/tag/homicides"><span class="tag-cloud__tag-name">Homicides</span></a></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="newsletter-subscribe-form grid--item content-footer__newsletter grid-layout__content"><h3 class="newsletter-subscribe-form__hed">This Week’s Issue</h3><div class="newsletter-subscribe-form__dek">Never miss a big <i>New Yorker</i> story again.

The first time that Jamie and Courtney met in person was at a gas station in the Hilltop. Jamie was turning twenty-six; Courtney was twenty-four. Jamie, who had long blond hair and dimples, was athletic and wore sporty clothes; Courtney, who had dark hair and a heart-shaped face, liked bling and bows, and had a horse named Taco. Both women had chosen full-time employment over college, and came from hardworking families in the Columbus suburbs.

What Jamie needed was treatment, not prison."],["p","Jamie faced a kind of criminal prosecution that takes various forms, depending on the jurisdiction. Such cases have been categorized as “drug-induced homicide,” “murder by overdose,” “drug delivery resulting in death,” and “overdose homicide.” More than two dozen states now have laws allowing prosecutors to bring felony charges against anyone who provides drugs that prove fatal. States without specific legislation, such as Ohio, can indict a supplier under existing statutes: manslaughter, depraved heart, reckless homicide, murder. Potential punishments range from a year in prison to death. According to a recent study by the Northeastern University School of Law’s Health in Justice Action Lab, prosecutors in almost every state have exercised the overdose-homicide option."],["p","Legal experts have traced these prosecutions to the fatal overdose of Len Bias, a superstar forward at the University of Maryland, who collapsed on June 19, 1986, in his dorm suite.

The Democrats were trying to retake the Senate, and wanted to prove that they could be tough on crime. House Speaker Tip O’Neill urged Congress to craft forceful antidrug legislation that candidates could cite in their reëlection campaigns. Eric Sterling, then the assistant counsel for the House Judiciary Committee, later recalled that lawmakers drafted the legislation without holding a single hearing, adding, “We did not consult with the Bureau of Prisons, or with the federal judiciary, or with D.E.A., or with the Justice Department.”"],["p","That October, Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. It established mandatory minimum prison sentences for a range of narcotics crimes, including a “death resulting” offense involving the sharing or the sale of drugs. Sterling, now the director of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation, which focusses on failed drug policy, has noted that Congress assumed the legislation would lead law-enforcement officials to target “high-level traffickers.” But America’s prisons soon filled with low-level offenders; illicit drug use and trafficking continued unabated."],["p","Policymakers and scholars eventually agreed that neither harsh penalties nor the threat of them significantly deters drug use and sales.

But in the past two decades, as opioid addiction escalated and overdoses became the leading cause of death in America for people under fifty, police officers and prosecutors seized upon the overdose-homicide alternative as a new “tool.” Now there are many hundreds of such cases a year."],["p","Like the federal law, the state statutes ostensibly targeted “high-level traffickers” and “repeat offenders.” Some career criminals have been caught in this way. Last year, a New Jersey woman fatally overdosed on fentanyl-tainted heroin; police charged the man who purportedly provided her with the drugs, and also Curtis Geathers, the man’s alleged source. Geathers had multiple priors: in the early two-thousands, he was prosecuted for attempted murder and went to prison for aggravated assault; in 2016, he pleaded guilty to trafficking after police found nearly six hundred packets of heroin, plus cash and crack, in his hotel room."],["p","But, as Northeastern has reported, overdose-homicide prosecutions tend to sweep up minor offenders who are “struggling with addiction and who purchase drugs on behalf of themselves and their peers.” Leo Beletsky, the director of the Northeastern law lab, studied two hundred and sixty-three prosecutions that occurred between 2000 and 2016, and ",["a",{"href":"https:\u002F\u002Fpapers.ssrn.com\u002Fsol3\u002Fpapers.cfm?abstract_id=3185180","isExternal":true},"found"]," that about half of the defendants were “friends, family, or romantic partners” of the person who died.

That year, a Florida sheriff warned, in a video that went viral on social media, “If our agents can show the nexus between you, the pusher of poison, and the person that overdoses and dies, we will charge you with murder.” The sheriff was flanked by four officers wearing body armor and balaclavas.

Minerd said, “To watch parents who have parented the right way, and who raised their kid in a community they thought was safe and that kid ",["em","still"]," overdosed? They’re not moral failures.

One day, ",["em",{"class":"small"},"swat"]," operators raided a house and found drugs, cash, and a gun. In another case, detectives met a compromised cartel courier in a trap house; they confiscated heroin that had been sewn into a pink velveteen pillow stitched with “There’s no place like ",["em",{"class":"small"},"HOME"],".” In a sting operation, detectives used hidden cameras, and the help of a real-estate agent, to arrest a woman who was accused of posing as a prospective home buyer in order to steal painkillers from people’s medicine cabinets. In an October case, a man was discovered dead, on his aunt’s sofa, surrounded by “Gone with the Wind” memorabilia and still holding the TV remote. Drug paraphernalia was present, but his cell phone offered no immediate leads on where he’d obtained the drugs; detectives inventoried it, anyway, in the hope that further scrutiny would yield clues.

Most Good Samaritan laws, which provide immunity to people who call for help, don’t apply to overdose-homicide cases. According to the Northeastern study, the statutes “create a quandary for people calling 911: you (probably) won’t get in trouble if the person experiencing an accidental overdose event survives, but if death occurs, you’re calling the cops on yourself.”"],["p","While Jamie was in prison, her parents took care of her newborn daughter and her sons.

Jamie got up at five-thirty every morning to mop floors and clean toilets. She was home by the time her kids got off the school bus. She took weekend and holiday shifts, for the overtime. In October, she received a promotion, to quality control, making $14.50 an hour. She would like a full-fledged job at the plant but has delayed applying, fearing that she’ll fail the company’s mandatory background check."],["p","Jamie sometimes regrets not allowing her case to go to trial. She wonders if there shouldn’t be a less severe kind of criminal charge for defendants who are not high-level traffickers. She wonders, too, what a jury would have made of Courtney’s autopsy, which revealed that she died not strictly of a heroin overdose but, rather, of a toxic combination of heroin and alprazolam—Xanax. Other substances found in her bloodstream included the sedative lorazepam and the depression medication Trazodone."],["p","In another case, in nearby Licking County, an appeals court recently overturned a conviction in a case involving a mixture of heroin and cocaine. And last year the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court struck down a conviction because prosecutors failed to prove that the defendant knew that the heroin he’d given a schoolmate would kill him. Because overdoses are often medically ambiguous, defendants might be wise to reject a plea offer and take their cases to trial. Leukel, the Florida attorney, told me, “The hammer of the criminal-justice system carries so much weight, people are accepting responsibility for things they shouldn’t be accepting responsibility for.”"],["p","If more prosecutors began losing such cases, they might stop making overdose-homicide charges against low-level offenders, especially people struggling with drug addiction themselves. This past December, the family of a Franklin County man who died after a friend gave him heroin asked the court not to impose a prison sentence. Such a punishment, they said, would be “the worst possible outcome.” The dead man’s sister told the judge, “It could easily have been the other way around.” ♦"]],"channelMap":{"A Neurologists Notebook":"A Neurologist’s Notebook","Blitts Kvetchbook":"Blitt’s Kvetchbook","Borowitz Report":"Satire From The Borowitz Report","Current":"The Current","Letter From The Uk":"Letter From The U.K.","Letter From Trumps Washington":"Letter From Trump’s Washington","Page Turner":"Page-Turner","Q And A":"Q. & A.","Shouts Murmurs":"Shouts & Murmurs","The Authors Voice":"The Writer’s Voice: Fiction from the Magazine"},"showBookmark":true,"featureFlags":{"enableAccounts":true,"enableAnalytics":true,"enableDropcap":true,"enableEntitlementProxy":true,"enableEntitlementValidation":true,"enableEntitlementGrantLogic":false,"enableGoogleAmp":true,"enablePayment":true,"enableRecipeRatings":false,"gridWidth":"full-bleed","hideDate":false,"hideRubric":false,"hideHomepageRelated":false,"hideRecircRiser":true,"ledeAlignment":"default","shouldExtractRecircRubricFromCategories":true,"summaryDisplayType":"default","isWideImageCard":false,"recentWorkTeaser":"rubric-or-channel","contentTeaser":"rubric-or-channel-or-section","navigationDecorationStyle":"border-thin","preferCollectionGrid":false,"fullWidthBlockStyle":"default","avatarImageShape":"round","overrideBodyContentHeadings":true,"thumbnailImageShape":"rectangle","enableSponsoredContentInRelated":false,"enableBookmarking":true,"enableRecipeActions":{"print":false,"save":false},"patternVariations":{"navigation":{"pattern":"Stacked"},"article":{"product-embed":"ImageLeft"},"gallery":{"slide":"ItemLeft"},"homepage":{"summaryCollageFive":{"rubric":"DiscoveryCard"},"summaryCollageOne":{"rubric":"DiscoveryCard"},"summaryCollageThree":{"rubric":"DiscoveryCard"},"summaryCollectionGrid":{"rubric":"DiscoveryItem"},"summaryCollectionRow":{"rubric":"DiscoveryItem"}}},"globalSettingsWhitelist":{"BasePage":["theme"],"ContentHeader":["theme"],"NavigationComponent":["theme"]},"personalizeInlineRecirc":true,"personalizeRecircList":true,"personalizeRecircMostPopular":true,"videoPersistable":false,"cnePlaylistTheme":"inherit","google":{"swgEnabled":false,"signInEnabled":false}},"hasProduct":false,"headerProps":{"brandedInfo":null,"contributorImage":{"altText":"","sources":{"sm":{"aspectRatio":"1:1","width":240,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F59097b811c7a8e33fb390218\u002F1:1\u002Fw_240,c_limit\u002Fwilliams-paige.png"},"md":{"aspectRatio":"1:1","width":240,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F59097b811c7a8e33fb390218\u002F1:1\u002Fw_240,c_limit\u002Fwilliams-paige.png"},"lg":{"aspectRatio":"1:1","width":270,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F59097b811c7a8e33fb390218\u002F1:1\u002Fw_270,c_limit\u002Fwilliams-paige.png"},"xl":{"aspectRatio":"1:1","width":270,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F59097b811c7a8e33fb390218\u002F1:1\u002Fw_270,c_limit\u002Fwilliams-paige.png"},"xxl":{"aspectRatio":"1:1","width":270,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.newyorker.com\u002Fphotos\u002F59097b811c7a8e33fb390218\u002F1:1\u002Fw_270,c_limit\u002Fwilliams-paige.png"}}},"contributors":{"author":{"items":[{"dangerousBio":"\u003Ca href=\"\u002Fcontributors\u002Fpaige-williams\"\u003EPaige Williams\u003C\u002Fa\u003E began writing for \u003Cem\u003EThe New Yorker\u003C\u002Fem\u003E in 2013 and became a staff writer in 2015.

Barrett and Mulligan drove past a clubhouse with a blue-and-yellow sign that read “Home of the Lady Eagles,” and stopped near a scrubby set of bleachers, where parents had gathered to watch their daughters bat and field.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo of the parents were lying on the ground, unconscious, several yards apart. As Barrett later recalled, the couple’s thirteen-year-old daughter was sitting behind a chain-link backstop with her teammates, who were hugging her and comforting her. The couple’s younger children, aged ten and seven, were running back and forth between their parents, screaming, “Wake up! Wake up!” When Barrett and Mulligan knelt down to administer Narcan, a drug that reverses heroin overdoses, some of the other parents got angry. “You know, saying, ‘This is bullcrap,’ ” Barrett told me. “ ‘Why’s my kid gotta see this? Just let ’em lay there.’ ” After a few minutes, the couple began to groan as they revived. Adults ushered the younger kids away. From the other side of the backstop, the older kids asked Barrett if the parents had overdosed. “I was, like, ‘I’m not gonna say.’ The kids aren’t stupid. They know people don’t just pass out for no reason.” During the chaos, someone made a call to Child Protective Services.\n\n\n\nAt this stage of the American opioid epidemic, many addicts are collapsing in public—in gas stations, in restaurant bathrooms, in the aisles of big-box stores. Brian Costello, a former Army medic who is the director of the Berkeley County Emergency Medical Services, believes that more overdoses are occurring in this way because users figure that somebody will find them before they die. “To people who don’t have that addiction, that sounds crazy,” he said. “But, from a health-care provider’s standpoint, you say to yourself, ‘No, this is survival to them.’ They’re struggling with using but not wanting to die.”\n\n\n\nA month after the incident, the couple from the softball field, Angel Dawn Holt, who is thirty-five, and her boyfriend, Christopher Schildt, who is thirty-three, were arraigned on felony charges of child neglect. (Schildt is not the biological father of Holt’s kids.) A local newspaper, the Martinsburg _Journal_, ran an article about the charges, noting that the couple’s children, who had been “crying when law enforcement arrived,” had been “turned over to their grandfather.”\n\n\n\nWest Virginia has the highest overdose death rate in the country, and heroin has devastated the state’s Eastern Panhandle, which includes Hedgesville and the larger town of Martinsburg. Like the vast majority of residents there, nearly all the addicts are white, were born in the area, and have modest incomes. Because they can’t be dismissed as outsiders, some locals view them with empathy. Other residents regard addicts as community embarrassments. Many people in the Panhandle have embraced the idea of addiction as a disease, but a vocal cohort dismisses this as a fantasy disseminated by urban liberals.\n\n\n\nThese tensions were aired in online comments that amassed beneath the _Journal_ article. A waitress named Sandy wrote, “Omgsh, How sad!! Shouldnt be able to have there kids back! Seems the heroin was more important to them, than watchn there kids have fun play ball, and have there parents proud of them!!” A poster named Valerie wrote, “Stop giving them Narcan! At the tax payers expense.” Such views were countered by a reader named Diana: “I’m sure the parents didn’t get up that morning and say hey let’s scar the kids for life. I’m sure they wished they could sit through the kids practice without having to get high. The only way to understand it is to have lived it. The children need to be in a safe home and the adults need help. They are sick, i know from the outside it looks like a choice but its not. Shaming and judging will not help anyone.”\n\n\n\nOne day, Angel Holt started posting comments. “I don’t neglect,” she wrote. “Had a bad judgment I love my kids and my kids love me there honor roll students my oldest son is about to graduate they play sports and have a ruff over there head that I own and food, and things they just want I messed up give me a chance to prove my self I don’t have to prove shit to none of u just my children n they know who I am and who I’m not.”\n\n\n\nA few weeks later, I spoke to Holt on the phone. “Where it happened was really horrible,” she said. “I can’t sit here and say different.” But, she said, it had been almost impossible to find help for her addiction. On the day of the softball practice, she ingested a small portion of a package of heroin that she and Schildt had just bought, figuring that she’d be able to keep it together at the field; she had promised her daughter that she’d be there. But the heroin had a strange purple tint—it must have been cut with something nasty. She started feeling weird, and passed out. She knew that she shouldn’t have touched heroin that was so obviously adulterated. But, she added, “if you’re an addict, and if you have the stuff, you do it.” \n\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F593b695a8a032b339a0cd9c8]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn Berkeley County, which has a population of a hundred and fourteen thousand, when someone under sixty dies, and the cause of death isn’t mentioned in the paper, locals assume that it was an overdose. It’s becoming the default explanation when an ambulance stops outside a neighbor’s house, and the best guess for why someone is sitting in his car on the side of the road in the middle of the afternoon. On January 18th, county officials started using a new app to record overdoses. According to this data, during the next two and a half months emergency medical personnel responded to a hundred and forty-five overdoses, eighteen of which were fatal. This underestimates the scale of the epidemic, because many overdoses do not prompt 911 calls. Last year, the county’s annual budget for emergency medication was twenty-seven thousand dollars. Narcan, which costs fifty dollars a dose, consumed two-thirds of that allotment. The medication was administered two hundred and twenty-three times in 2014, and four hundred and three times in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne Thursday in March, a few weeks before Michael Barrett responded to Angel Holt’s overdose, I rode with him in his paramedic vehicle, a specially equipped S.U.V. He started his day as he often does, with bacon and eggs at the Olde Country Diner, in Martinsburg. Barrett, who is thirty-three, with a russet-colored beard and mustache, works two twenty-four-hour shifts a week, starting at 7 *a*{: .small}.*m*{: .small}. The diner shares a strip mall with the E.M.T. station, and, if he has to leave on a call before he can finish eating, the servers will box up his food in a hurry. Barrett’s father and his uncles were volunteer firemen in the area, and, growing up, he often accompanied them in the fire truck. As they’d pull people from crumpled cars or burning buildings, he’d say to himself, “Man, they _doing_ stuff—they’re awesome.” When Barrett became a paramedic, in his twenties, he knew that he could make a lot more money “going down the road,” as people around here say, referring to Baltimore or Washington, D.C. But he liked it when older colleagues told him, “I used to hold you at the fire department when you were a baby.”\n\n\n\nBarrett’s first overdose call of the day came at 8 *a*{: .small}.*m*{: .small}., for a twenty-year-old woman. Several family members were present at the home, and while Barrett and his colleagues worked on her they cried and blamed one another, and themselves, for not watching her more closely. The woman was given Narcan, but she was too far gone; she died after arriving at the hospital.\n\n\n\nWe stopped by a local fire station, where the men and women on duty talked about all the O.D. calls they took each week. Sometimes they knew the person from high school, or were related to the person. Barrett said that in such cases you tended “to get more angry at them—you’re, like, ‘Man, you got a _kid_, what the hell’s wrong with you?’ ”\n\n\n\nBarrett sometimes had to return several times in one day to the same house—once, a father, a mother, and a teen-age daughter overdosed on heroin in succession. Such stories seemed like twisted variations on the small-town generational solidarity he admired; as Barrett put it, even if one family member wanted to get clean, it would be next to impossible unless the others did, too. He was used to O.D. calls by now, except for the ones in which kids were around. He once arrived at a home to find a seven-year-old and a five-year-old following the instructions of a 911 operator and performing C.P.R. on their parents. (They survived.)\n\n\n\nAround three o’clock, the dispatcher reported that a man in Hedgesville was slumped over the steering wheel of a jeep. By the time we got there, the man, who appeared to be in his early thirties, had been helped out of his vehicle and into an ambulance. A skinny young sheriff’s deputy on the scene showed us a half-filled syringe: the contents resembled clean sand, which suggested pure heroin. That was a good thing—these days, the narcotic is often cut with synthetic painkillers such as fentanyl, which is fifty times as powerful as heroin.\n\n\n\nThe man had floppy brown hair and a handsome face; he was wearing jeans, work boots, and a black windbreaker. He’d been revived with oxygen—he hadn’t needed Narcan—but as he sat in the ambulance his eyes were only partly opened, and his pupils, when I could catch a glimpse of them, were constricted to pinpoints. Barrett asked him, “Did you take a half syringe? ’Cause there’s half a syringe left.” The man looked up briefly and said, “Yeah? I was trying to take it all.” He said that he was sorry—he’d been clean for a month. Then he mumbled something about having a headache. “Well, sure you do,” another paramedic said. “You weren’t breathing there for a while. Your brain didn’t have any oxygen.”\n\n\n\nThe man’s jeep sat, dead still, in the middle of a street that sloped sharply downhill. A woman introduced herself to me as Ethel. She had been driving behind the man when he lost consciousness. “I just rolled up, saw he was slumped over the wheel,” she said. “I knew what it was right away.” She beeped her horn, but he didn’t move. She called 911 and stayed until the first responders showed up, “in case he started to roll forward, and maybe I could stop traffic—and to make sure he was O.K.” I asked if the man’s jeep had been running during this time. “Oh, yeah,” she said. “He just happened to stop with his foot on the brake.” Barrett shared some protocol: whenever he came across people passed out in a car, he put the transmission in park and took their keys, in case they abruptly revived. He’d heard of people driving off with E.M.T. personnel halfway inside.\n\n\n\nThe sky was a dazzling blue, with fluffy white clouds scudding overhead. The man took a sobriety test, wobbling across the neat lawn of a Methodist church. “That guy’s still high as a kite,” somebody said. \n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F59277ac45e3b915b0ae1110d]|||\n\nTara Mayson, Tina Stride, and Lisa Melcher run the Hope Dealer Project, which helps addicts find a spot in rehab. *Photograph by Eugene Richards for The New Yorker*{: .credit}\n\n|||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nWe were driving away from Hedgesville when the third overdose call of the day came, for a twenty-nine-year-old male. Inside a nicely kept house in a modern subdivision, the man was lying unconscious on the bathroom floor, taking intermittent gasps. He was pale, though not yet the blue-tinged gray that people turn when they’ve been breathing poorly for a while. Opioid overdoses usually kill people by inhibiting respiration: breathing slows and starts to sound labored, then stops altogether. Barrett began preparing a Narcan dose. Generally, the goal was to get people breathing well again, not necessarily to wake them completely. A full dose of Narcan is two milligrams, and in Berkeley County the medics administer 0.4 milligrams at a time, so as not to snatch patients’ high away too abruptly: you didn’t want them to go into instant withdrawal, feel terribly sick, and become belligerent. Barrett crouched next to the man and started an I.V. A minute later, the man sat up, looking bewildered and resentful. He threw up. Barrett said, “Couple more minutes and you would have died, buddy.”\n\n\n\n“Thank you,” the man said.\n\n\n\n“You’re welcome—but now you need to go to the hospital.”\n\n\n\nThe man’s girlfriend was standing nearby, her hair in a loose bun. She responded calmly to questions: “Yeah, he does heroin”; “Yeah, he just ate.” The family dog was snuffling at the front door, and one of the sheriff’s deputies asked if he could let it outside. The girlfriend said, “Sure.” Brian Costello had told me that family members had grown oddly comfortable with E.M.T. visits: “That’s the scary part—that it’s becoming the norm.” The man stood up, and then, swaying in the doorway, vomited a second time.\n\n\n\n“We’re gonna take him to the hospital,” Barrett told the girlfriend. “He could stop breathing again.”\n\n\n\nAs we drove away, Barrett predicted that the man would check himself out of the hospital as soon as he could; most O.D. patients refused further treatment. Even a brush with death was rarely a turning point for an addict. “It’s kind of hard to feel good about it,” Barrett said of the intervention. “Though he did say, ‘Thanks for waking me up.’ Well, that’s our job. But do you feel like you’re really making a difference? Ninety-nine per cent of the time, no.” The next week, Barrett’s crew was called back to the same house repeatedly. The man overdosed three times; his girlfriend, once.\n\n\n\nIt was getting dark, and Barrett stopped at a convenience store for a snack—chocolate milk and a beef stick. That evening, he dealt with one more O.D. A young woman had passed out in her car in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven, with her little girl squirming in a car seat. An older woman who happened on the scene had taken the girl, a four-year-old, into the store and bought her some hot chocolate and Skittles. After the young woman received Narcan, Barrett told her that she could have killed her daughter, and she started sobbing hysterically. Meanwhile, several guys in the parking lot were becoming agitated. They had given the woman C.P.R., but someone had called 911 and suggested that they had supplied her with the heroin. The men were black and everybody else—the overdosing woman, the older woman, the cops, the ambulance crew—was white. The men were told to remain at the scene while the cops did background checks. Barrett attempted to defuse the tension by saying, “Hey, you guys gave her C.P.R.? Thanks. We really appreciate that.” The criminal checks turned up nothing; there was no reason to suspect that the men were anything but Good Samaritans. The cops let the men go, the young woman went to the E.R., and the little girl was retrieved by her father.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nHeroin is an alluringly cheap alternative to prescription pain medication. In 1996, Purdue Pharma introduced OxyContin, marketing it as a safer form of opiate—the class of painkillers derived from the poppy plant. (The term “opioids” encompasses synthetic versions of opiates as well.) Opiates such as morphine block pain but also produce a dreamy euphoria, and over time they cause physical cravings. OxyContin was sold in time-release capsules that levelled out the high and, supposedly, diminished the risk of addiction, but people soon discovered that the capsules could be crushed into powder and then injected or snorted. Between 2000 and 2014, the number of overdose deaths in the United States jumped by a hundred and thirty-seven per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome states became inundated with opiates. According to the Charleston _Gazette-Mail_, between 2007 and 2012 drug wholesalers shipped to West Virginia seven hundred and eighty million pills of hydrocodone (the generic name for Vicodin) and oxycodone (the generic name for OxyContin). That was enough to give each resident four hundred and thirty-three pills. The state has a disproportionate number of people who have jobs that cause physical pain, such as coal mining. It also has high levels of poverty and joblessness, which cause psychic pain. Mental-health services, meanwhile, are scant. Chess Yellott, a retired family practitioner in Martinsburg, told me that many West Virginians self-medicate to mute depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress from sexual assault or childhood abuse. “Those things are treatable, and upper-middle-class parents generally get their kids treated,” he said. “But, in families with a lot of chaos and money problems, kids don’t get help.”\n\n\n\nIn 2010, Purdue introduced a reformulated capsule that is harder to crush or dissolve. The Centers for Disease Control subsequently issued new guidelines stipulating that doctors should not routinely treat chronic pain with opioids, and instead should try approaches such as exercise and behavioral therapy. The number of prescriptions for opioids began to drop.\n\n\n\nBut when prescription opioids became scarcer their street price went up. Drug cartels sensed an opportunity, and began flooding rural America with heroin. Daniel Ciccarone, a professor at the U.C.-San Francisco School of Medicine, studies the heroin market. He said of the cartels, “They’re multinational, savvy, borderless entities. They worked very hard to move high-quality heroin into places like rural Vermont.” They also kept the price low. In West Virginia, many addicts told me, an oxycodone pill now sells for about eighty dollars; a dose of heroin can be bought for about ten.\n\n\n\nA recent paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research concludes, “Following the OxyContin reformulation in 2010, abuse of prescription opioid medications and overdose deaths decreased for the first time since 1990. However, this drop coincided with an unprecedented rise in heroin overdoses.” According to the Centers for Disease Control, three out of four new heroin users report having first abused opioids.\n\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F593b695bedb25442b234e9a3]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Changing Face of Heroin Use in the United States,” a 2014 study led by Theodore Cicero, of Washington University in St. Louis, looked at some three thousand heroin addicts in substance-abuse programs. Half of those who began using heroin before 1980 were white; nearly ninety per cent of those who began using in the past decade were white. This demographic shift may be connected to prescribing patterns. A 2012 study by a University of Pennsylvania researcher found that black patients were thirty-four per cent less likely than white patients to be prescribed opioids for such chronic conditions as back pain and migraines, and fourteen per cent less likely to receive such prescriptions after surgery or traumatic injury.\n\n\n\nBut a larger factor, it seems, was the despair of white people in struggling small towns. Judith Feinberg, a professor at West Virginia University who studies drug addiction, described opioids as “the ultimate escape drugs.” She told me, “Boredom and a sense of uselessness and inadequacy—these are human failings that lead you to just want to withdraw. On heroin, you curl up in a corner and blank out the world. It’s an extremely seductive drug for dead-end towns, because it makes the world’s problems go away. Much more so than coke or meth, where you want to run around and _do_ things—you get aggressive, razzed and jazzed.”\n\n\n\nPeter Callahan, a psychotherapist in Martinsburg, said that heroin “is a very tough drug to get off of, because, while it was meant to numb _physical_ pain, it numbs emotional pain as well—quickly and intensely.” In tight-knit Appalachian towns, heroin has become a social contagion. Nearly everyone I met in Martinsburg has ties to someone—a child, a sibling, a girlfriend, an in-law, an old high-school coach—who has struggled with opioids. As Callahan put it, “If the lady next door is using, and so are other neighbors, and people in your family are, too, the odds are good that you’re going to join in.”\n\n\n\nIn 2015, Berkeley County created a new position, recovery-services coördinator, to connect residents with rehab. Yet there is a chronic shortage of beds in the state for addicts who want help. Kevin Knowles, who was appointed to the job, told me, “If they have private insurance, I can hook them right up. If they’re on Medicaid—and ninety-five per cent of the people I work with are—it’s going to be a long wait for them. Weeks, months.” He said, “The number of beds would have to increase by a factor of three or four to make any impact.”\n\n\n\nWest Virginia has an overdose death rate of 41.5 per hundred thousand people. (New Hampshire has the second-highest rate: 34.3 per hundred thousand.) This year, for the sixth straight year, West Virginia’s indigent burial fund, which helps families who can’t afford a funeral pay for one, ran out of money. Fred Kitchen, the president of the West Virginia Funeral Directors Association, told me that, in the funeral business, “we know the reason for that was the increase in overdose deaths.” He added, “Families take out second mortgages, cash in 401(k)s, and go broke to try and save a son or daughter, who then overdoses and dies.” Without the help of the burial fund, funeral directors must either give away caskets, plots, and cremation services—and risk going out of business—or, Kitchen said, look “mothers, fathers, husbands, wives, and children in the eye while they’re saying, ‘You have nothing to help us?’ ”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nMartinsburg, which has a population of seventeen thousand, is a hilly town filled with brick and clapboard row houses. It was founded in 1778, by Adam Stephen, a Revolutionary War general. The town became a depot for the B. & O. Railroad and grew into an industrial center dominated by woollen mills. Interwoven, established in the eighteen-nineties, was the first electric-powered textile plant in the U.S. The company became the largest men’s-sock manufacturer in the world, and at its height, in the nineteen-fifties, it employed three thousand people in Martinsburg. The Interwoven factory whistle could be heard all over town, summoning workers every morning at a quarter to seven. In 1971, when the mill closed, an editorial in the Martinsburg _Journal_ mourned the passing of “what was once this community’s greatest pride.” In 2004, the last woollen mill in town, Royce Hosiery, ceased operations.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s simplistic to trace the town’s opioid epidemic directly to the loss of industrial jobs. Nevertheless, many residents I met brought up this history, as part of a larger story of lost purpose that has made the town vulnerable to the opioid onslaught. In 2012, Macy’s opened a distribution center in the Martinsburg area, but, Knowles said, the company has found it difficult to hire longtime residents, because so many fail the required drug test. (The void has been filled, only partially, by people from neighboring states.) Knowles wonders if Procter & Gamble, which is opening a manufacturing plant in the area this fall, will have a similar problem.\n\n\n\nThe Eastern Panhandle is one of the wealthier parts of a poor state. (The most destitute counties depend on coal mining.) Berkeley County is close enough to D.C. and Baltimore that many residents commute for work. Nevertheless, Martinsburg feels isolated. Several people I met there expressed surprise, or sympathy, when I told them that I live in D.C., or politely said that they’d like to visit the capital one of these days. Like every other county in West Virginia, Berkeley County voted for Donald Trump. \n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F59277ac78f6ae922df49550e]|||\n\nThe Interwoven mill, derelict and grand, dominates the center of Martinsburg. A local police officer has proposed turning most of the mill into a rehab facility. *Photograph by Eugene Richards for The New Yorker*{: .credit}\n\n|||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nMichael Chalmers is the publisher of an Eastern Panhandle newspaper, the _Observer_. It is based in Shepherdstown, a picturesque college town near the Maryland border which has not succumbed to heroin. Chalmers, who is forty-two, grew up in Martinsburg, and in 2014 he lost his younger brother, Jason, to an overdose. I asked him why he thought that Martinsburg was struggling so much with drugs. “In my opinion, the desperation in the Panhandle, and places like it, is a _social_ vacancy,” he said. “People don’t feel they have a purpose.” There was a “shame element in small-town culture.” Many drug addicts, he explained, are “trying to escape the reality that this place doesn’t give them anything.” He added, “That’s really hard to live with—when you look around and you see that seven out of ten of your friends from high school are still here, and nobody makes more than thirty-six thousand a year, and everybody’s just bitching about bills and watching these crazy shows on reality TV and not _doing anything_.”\n\n\n\nThe Interwoven mill, derelict and grand, still dominates the center of Martinsburg. One corner of it has been turned into a restaurant, but the rest sits empty. Lately, there’s been talk of an ambitious renovation. A police officer named Andrew Garcia has a plan, called Martinsburg Renew, which would turn most of the mill into a rehab facility. Todd Funkhouser, who runs the Berkeley County Historical Society, showed me around one day. “Martinsburg is an industrial town,” he said. “That’s its identity. But what’s the industry now? Maybe it will be drug rehab.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn the past several months, I have returned to Martinsburg many times, and spoken with many addicts there. I learned the most about the crisis, however, from residents who weren’t drug users, but whose lives had been irrevocably altered by others’ addiction.\n\n\n\n\n\nLori Swadley is a portrait and wedding photographer in Martinsburg. When I looked at her Web site, she seemed to be in demand all over the area, and her photographs were lovely: her brides glowed in afternoon light, her high-school seniors looked polished and confident. But what drew me to her was a side project she had been pursuing, called 52 Addicts—a series of portraits that called attention to the drug epidemic in and around Martinsburg. It was clear that Swadley had a full life: her husband, Jon, worked with her in the photography business, and they had three small children, Juniper, Bastian, and Bodhi. Her Web site noted that she loved fashion and gardening, and included this declaration: “I’m happy that you’ve stumbled upon our little slice of heaven!” The 52 Addicts series seemed like a surprising project for someone so busy and cheerful.\n\n\n\nWe met one day at Mugs & Muffins, a cozy coffee shop on Queen Street. Swadley is thirty-nine, tall and slender, and she looked elegant in jeans, a charcoal-colored turtleneck, and high boots. She and her husband had moved to Martinsburg in 2010, she told me, looking for an affordable place to raise children close to where she had grown up, in the Shenandoah Valley. Soon after they arrived, they settled into a subdivision outside town, and Swadley started reading the Martinsburg _Journal_ online. She told me, “I’d see these stories about addiction—whether it was somebody who’d passed away, and the family wanted to tell their story, or it was the overdose statistics, or whatever.” Many of the stories were written by the same reporter, Jenni Vincent. “She was very persistent, and—I don’t know what the word for it is—very _in your face_,” Swadley said. “You could tell she wanted the problem to be known. Because at that time it seemed like everybody else wanted to hide it. And, to me, that seemed like the worst thing you could do.”\n\n\n\nIt turned out that thirteen of Swadley’s friends had died of opioid overdoses. I said that it seemed like an extraordinarily high number, especially for someone who was not an addict. She agreed, but there it was. All thirteen were young men—Swadley had met most of them when she was in her early twenties, and she had been a tomboy back then. The first time she heard that a friend had died, she had been photographing a wedding for some mutual friends. They were sitting around a bonfire at the end of the day. When Swadley spoke of a crazy horror film that she and a guy named Jeremy had made in high school, somebody mentioned that he had recently died, from a heroin overdose. Swadley felt like she’d been punched in the gut. She threw up, and wrecked her car on the way home.\n\n\n\nAt the time, Swadley was hanging out with her old crowd in bars and restaurants every weekend. One by one, the group dwindled. Many of them—“the preppy boys, the hippie boys”—got into heroin eventually, she said. They tried to help one another, but “we were in our twenties—we had no clue.” She’d call rehab places on friends’ behalf and have to tell them that the price was staggering, and that in any case it might be six months before they could be admitted. As the overdoses piled up, she was appalled to find that sometimes she had trouble keeping track of which friends were dead.\n\n\n\nThe funerals had a peculiar aspect. “The parents didn’t want anyone to know how it had happened, and they tried to keep the friends out,” she said. At the services for one friend—a sweet, goofy guy with shaggy blond hair—Swadley and her friends got close enough to the casket to see that his hair had been shorn, so that “he looked clean-cut.” She went on, “It was clear that his mother didn’t want us there. It was understandable—she didn’t know if any of us had been supplying him.”\n\n\n\nOne day_,_ Swadley decided that she needed to write down all thirteen names, before she forgot one. In January, 2016, she started photographing addicts in recovery. In her introduction to the series, on Instagram, she wrote about her friends who had died and about Martinsburg’s lack of rehab centers. She found the town’s culture of denial enraging.\n\n\n\nFor the first few portraits, Swadley reached out to her subjects, but soon people started coming to her. She took their pictures, asked them about their lives, and told their stories in a paragraph or so. There are now two dozen images in the series.\n\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F593b695dedb25442b234e9a6]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one of the portraits, an E.R. nurse hugs her daughter, Hope, from whom she’d been estranged. They had reconnected at the hospital, when the nurse saw Hope’s name listed as a patient in the emergency room. Swadley photographed a Martinsburg woman named Crystal, who’d been hit by a car one night when she was walking to her dealer’s house; Crystal was now clean, but she was confined to a wheelchair. A woman named Tiffany posed holding a snapshot of her younger sister, Tabby. Both women had started off on pills—Tabby had developed a problem after a gallbladder operation left her with a thirty-day supply of meds—and then became heroin addicts. Tiffany had received treatment, but Tabby had fatally overdosed while she was waiting for a rehab bed. Swadley took the portrait in a park where Tiffany had once begged Tabby to stop using. When I called Tiffany, she told me that she had recently lost a second sister to heroin.\n\n\n\nSwadley hopes that her photographs will someday be displayed all around town—in coffee shops, restaurants, perhaps the library. She wants a public reckoning with the stories she’s collected. “The whole point of this project is to show naysayers out there that people do recover,” she said. “They are good people. I want to show people they deserve a chance. I want it in people’s faces, so they see that it could be their neighbor, or their best friend.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nOne day, Swadley told me about a local effort against heroin addiction, called the Hope Dealer Project. It was run by three women: Tina Stride, who had a twenty-six-year-old son in recovery; Tara Mayson, whose close friend had gone through periods of addiction; and Lisa Melcher, whose son-in-law had died of an overdose, and whose thirty-two-year-old daughter, Christina, was struggling to overcome heroin addiction. All three had known addicts who wanted to get clean but had no place to go. Last fall, like car-pool moms with a harrowing new mission, they had begun driving people to detox facilities all over the state—any place that could take them, sometimes as far as five hours away. The few with private insurance could get rehab anywhere in the country, and the Hope Dealer women were prepared to suggest options. But most people in town had Medicaid or no insurance at all, and such addicts had to receive treatment somewhere in the state. Currently, the detox facility closest to Martinsburg is about two hours away.\n\n\n\n\n\nStride works full time at the General Services Administration, in Washington, but spends up to twenty-four hours a week giving rides to drug users. The other two focus on reaching out to addicts and families. Stride noted, “I have to talk to the addict, or the client—that’s what we try to call them—all the way to that detox center. Because they’re sick. And we pass hospitals all the way, and they’re begging, ‘Just take me there—they can help me!’ But they really can’t, the hospitals.”\n\n\n\nWhen Stride and her client arrive at a detox facility, nurses are waiting at the door. At that point, Stride said, “they’re, like, ‘What do you mean, you’re _leaving_ me?’ ” She went on, “They’re scared, because now it’s reality. They know they’re not going to get their dope or their pills. For them to walk in those doors, that takes a lot. They’re heroes to me.”\n\n\n\nAfter five to ten days in detox, patients are released. “When our clients get clean and the drugs are out of their system, they believe they’re O.K.,” Stride said. “And they’re not. That’s just getting the poison out of their bodies. So we try to explain to them, ‘No, you need to go through rehab, and learn _why_ you are using, and learn how to fight it.’ Some will do it. Some won’t. And then our issue becomes how we’re going to find them a bed in rehab. If beds are all full, a lot of times they come back here to Martinsburg, because they have nowhere else to go.” Stride tries to keep those clients under constant watch. “That addict brain is telling them, ‘You know what you need, and it’s right here—go get it.’ ”\n\n\n\nStride usually drives clients to a detox center immediately after picking them up. But once she had to keep a woman overnight at her home, because a bed wasn’t available until the morning. She told me, “All I said was ‘Please, don’t rob me. I’m here to help you. But I guess if you _are_ gonna rob me there’s not a whole lot I can do about it.’ This young lady had to go through the night—she was so sick, she didn’t sleep. I tried to stay up, but I knew I had to drive four hours to the detox place, and four hours back. So I slept some. We were up at 4 *a*{: .small}.*m*{: .small}., and at the detox place at eight. And she’s doing good now—she calls me to touch base sometimes.”\n\n\n\nThe Hope Dealer women and I met near an apartment complex that Melcher manages, and drank mochas that she had bought at McDonald’s. Melcher, who is fifty-three, with abundant blond ringlets and a warm, husky voice, told me that she loved flower arranging and refinishing old furniture—activities that would be occupying her days more often if there weren’t a heroin crisis. Stride, who is forty-seven, wore her hair in a ponytail and had curly bangs; Mayson, who is forty-six, had long, sparkly nails.\n\n\n\nAt one point, Stride said, “Please don’t think I’m rude,” as she picked up her phone to read a text.\n\n\n\n“He’s in!” she cried. “He made it!”\n\n\n\nThe women cheered.\n\n\n\nThey had spent the previous day working on behalf of a woman and her twenty-one-year-old son, a heroin addict. He had private insurance, so they had signed him up for rehab in New Hampshire. “We had a plane ticket ready, and they were ready to go to the airport,” Stride said. “I left them, and then the mother called me and said, ‘My son’s lips are blue—he’s overdosed. What do I do?’ ” Stride became teary. “And I said, ‘Call 911. I’m coming right back over.’ ” \n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F59277acb0f1eda6025037313]|||\n\nSamantha Engelhardt (right), a recovering addict, shows her newborn baby to the photographer Lori Swadley, who has been documenting the opioid epidemic in the Martinsburg area. *Photograph by Eugene Richards for The New Yorker*{: .credit}\n\n|||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nStride went on, “So he was in the hospital, and then his mom reached out to me late last night and said, ‘He’s been released.’ First question I asked is ‘Where is he?,’ because we’re afraid he’s going to run. And she said, ‘Instead of putting him on a plane, can we drive him? Because I want to know he makes it.’ And I said, ‘Yes, you can.’ So they are driving eight hours to take him to his detox. Detox was good to go—so we know for the next seven to ten days he’s safe.” After that, the man was set to go to Florida, to attend a thirty-day program that Stride respected.\n\n\n\nMelcher said, “Praise God, he made it,” and the women all nodded.\n\n\n\nMayson, who works at the Department of Veterans Affairs and has two adult children, said that the Hope Dealer women had become like sisters. When one of them has a hard day, she can count on one of the others to tell her to rest and recharge—or, as Melcher often says, to “_breeeathe_.”\n\n\n\nAs mothers, they felt that they had a particular ability to communicate with women who needed help with their addicted children. Stride said, “I remember when I first found out my son was an addict. I was devastated. I didn’t know who to turn to, who I could trust. And I worked and worked to find my son a place, and that’s rough. Hearing ‘No’ or ‘We can’t take him today, but we can take him a week from today.’ ‘No, you need to take him _now_. My son’s gonna _die.’_ So now, when moms reach out to us, we’re, like, ‘We’ve got this.’ ”\n\n\n\nMelcher said, “When you’re in that space? Oh, my gosh, you can hardly breathe, you’re a cryin’ mess.”\n\n\n\nStride nodded and said, “So when we come in and say, ‘Mom, we’re gonna take care of your child,’ I don’t care if that child is fifty years old—you see a relief.”\n\n\n\nOn May 21st, I received an e-mail from Melcher, informing me that Christina, her daughter, had fatally overdosed on heroin. Christina, she said, had completed rehab several times, and had been clean for ninety days before relapsing. Melcher refused to hide the fact that Christina had “lost her battle with addiction,” but added, “When a child passes away, the last thing a mother wants to say is that the child was an addict.” Melcher plans to continue her volunteer work, in honor of Christina’s “beautiful but tortured life.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nJohn Aldis doesn’t look like a maverick. He’s seventy-one, white-haired and pink-cheeked, with a neat mustache, half-rimmed spectacles, and a penchant for sweater vests and bow ties. You could imagine him being cast as the Stage Manager in a production of “Our Town.” But two years ago Aldis became the first doctor in West Virginia to offer free public classes to teach anybody—not just first responders and health professionals—how to reverse overdoses with Narcan.\n\n\n\n\n\nAldis is a family practitioner with a background in public health and tropical medicine. His mother taught nursing, and his father was an obstetrician. “We never made it through the second feature at the drive-in,” Aldis recalled. “He would always be summoned over the loudspeaker to attend a birth.” There was no question in Aldis’s mind that he would become a doctor, too. He spent most of his career in Asia and Africa, as a U.S. Navy physician and as a medical officer with the State Department. He retired in 2001. He and his wife, Pheny, a medical technologist, bought the house where he’d lived as a small child, in Shepherdstown. They filled it with art and antiques, acquired two Jack Russell terriers, and prepared for a quiet life filled with visits from their two daughters and the grandkids.\n\n\n\nBut Aldis soon became aware of the opioid epidemic in the Eastern Panhandle—several people he’d hired to work on his house were “good fellows” who were also addicts. “When I started to see it, I could not look away,” he told me. He took a job at the New Life Clinic, in Martinsburg, where he could prescribe Suboxone, one of the long-term treatments for opioid addiction. He found it enormously frustrating that addicts were often urged to quit heroin cold turkey or to stop taking Suboxone (or methadone or naltrexone, the other drugs used to treat addiction and counteract withdrawal symptoms). In his view, this was wholly unrealistic. Most addicts needed what is known as medication-assisted treatment for a long time, if not the rest of their lives. He found the work at the clinic the most satisfying he’d done since graduating from medical school, forty-six years earlier. Patients struggled, and many of them failed, but when one of them told him, “Doc, I talked to my mom for the first time in three years yesterday,” that was, Aldis said, “just the greatest thing.”\n\n\n\nAldis is generally a forbearing man, but he can be dismissive of people who don’t share his sense of urgency. As he wrote to me in an e-mail, “The lack of understanding of medication-assisted treatment among otherwise reasonably intelligent people at all levels of our community is astounding and (for me) completely unacceptable.”\n\n\n\nIn 2015, West Virginia University’s Injury Control Research Center, along with several state and county agencies, started investigating ways to make naloxone—the generic name for Narcan—more widely available, in the hope of saving people in the throes of an overdose. Aldis attended a talk on the subject by the center’s deputy director, Herb Linn, and afterward he told him, “Let’s not study this anymore. Let’s just start a program.” Linn recalls, “I told him, ‘Just do it! You could actually prescribe it to your patients.’ ”\n\n\n\nAldis taught his first class on administering Narcan on September 3, 2015, at the New Life Clinic. Nine days later, a woman who’d attended the class used Narcan to revive a pregnant woman who had overdosed at a motel where they were both staying. During the next few weeks, Aldis heard of five more lives saved by people who’d attended the class.\n\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F593b695eedb25442b234e9a9]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his seminars, Aldis addresses why addicts’ lives are worth saving. That might seem self-evident, but at this point in the opioid epidemic many West Virginians feel too exhausted and resentful to help. People like Lori Swadley and the Hope Dealer women and John Aldis must combat a widespread attitude of “Leave ’em lie, let ’em die.” A community sucked dry by addiction becomes understandably wary of coddling users, and some locals worry that making Narcan easily available could foster complacency about overdoses.\n\n\n\nWilliam Poe, a paramedic, told me, “The thing about Narcan is that it kind of makes it O.K. to overdose, because then you can keep it in your house and keep it private. And a lot of times _we’re_ the wake-up call. I remember one time, we had a kid who had O.D.’d, and we had him in the ambulance. A call came over the radio—someone about his age had just died from an overdose. And the kid was, like, ‘I’m so glad you guys brought me back.’ ” It was humiliating when an ambulance showed up at your house and carted you out, pale and retching, but it also might push you to change. Then again, Poe mused, when most of your neighbors—not to mention your mom and your grandma—already knew that you used heroin, shaming might have little effect.\n\n\n\nThis past winter, I watched Aldis teach two classes in Berkeley Springs, an Eastern Panhandle town, at a storefront church between a convenience store and a pawnshop. The bare trees on the ridge above us were outlined like black lace against the twilight. Inside, a few dozen people, mostly women, sipped coffee from Styrofoam cups in an unadorned room with a low ceiling, tan carpeting, and rows of tan chairs.\n\n\n\nAldis touched briefly on what an overdose looks like, but acknowledged that the attendees probably already knew. (“Oh, Lord, yes,” a woman behind me said.) He demonstrated how to spray Narcan up a patient’s nose—take-home kits come in atomizer form—and announced that at the end of class he’d be writing prescriptions, which those in attendance could get filled at a pharmacy. If they had Medicaid or private insurance, the kit would cost only a few dollars; if they didn’t, it could cost anywhere from a hundred and twenty-five to three hundred dollars. At the first meeting I attended, in November, a few women began to cry when they heard that. At the second, in January, Aldis had some good news: the state had agreed to provide a hundred and eighty free kits.\n\n\n\nAldis told me that he’d like to see Narcan “inundating the community.” It carried no potential for abuse, and couldn’t harm you if someone gave it to you mistaking some other medical emergency for an overdose. “They ought to be selling this stuff next to the peanut butter in the Walmart,” he liked to say. And free supplies of Narcan should be everywhere, like fire extinguishers: “kitchen cabinets, your purse, schools, gyms, shopping malls, motels.”\n\n\n\nAldis had been invited to Berkeley Springs by Melody Stotler, who ran a local organization for recovering addicts. She said to the class, “Unfortunately, there are people in this community who don’t understand addiction, who don’t think Narcan should be out there.”\n\n\n\n“They say we’re enablers,” Aldis put in. “Somebody who has a heart attack—are we enabling them by giving them C.P.R.? ‘But their cholesterol’s too high! We shouldn’t have saved his life!’ ” People laughed ruefully.\n\n\n\nAldis introduced Kathy Williams, a former patient of his and the mother of two little girls. She had twice saved people with Narcan. One time, while she was driving, she spotted a car on the side of the road, and a man lying on his back next to it. The other time, a neighbor in her apartment complex knocked on her door and said that a guy was overdosing in the parking lot. “So I grabbed my Narcan kit, and I ran out there,” she recalled. She saw a woman tending to a man. “What had happened was that these two had stopped at Kmart. She went in to pick up her layaways, and when she came out he had just done shooting up, and said, ‘Please take me home.’ Well, he was overdosing from Kmart all the way. By the time I got there, he was in the back of the car, completely blue, and I had another guy help me pull him out—a neighbor, ’cause where I live, I been there almost thirty years now, and I know everybody. A couple people saw me running, and they started running, too, because they said, ‘Kathy’s running—something must be going on.’ We gave him two doses of Narcan, and by the time the E.M.T. got there his eyes were just starting to flicker, and I really thought we were too late.” The man began to stir.\n\n\n\nA woman named Tara, who was at the January meeting with her teen-age stepdaughter, told me that she had revived a guy who lived in the trailer park where she did some babysitting. He’d refused to go to the hospital, even though he was “puking like he was possessed.” I asked Tara—who was thirty, and had a soft, kind face—if the man had said anything to her after she saved him. “Every day, the next four days after that, he thanked me every time,” she told me. “He also said it was stupid and he’d never do that again, which wasn’t true, because he was arrested for driving under the influence of heroin a few weeks ago. Nodded out in the McDonald’s parking lot. Someone called the police.”\n\n\n\nTara wasn’t judging. She was a recovering addict herself—seven years now. She was studying to be a medical assistant. \n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F59277acf492109226cd59ff0]|||\n\nDr. John Aldis, at his home office in Shepherdstown.

He crawled around on all fours, pretending to be a pony, to amuse his daughter, Jacey, and her younger brother, Liam. He submitted to Jacey whenever she wanted to cover his face with makeup. When Jacey was six months old, Jason wrote a letter to his grandparents in which he described the “absolute, overwhelming” love that he felt for his daughter. “It’s not for or about me any more,” he wrote. “That’s probably for the best because I never did well with myself. She deserves a father who’s going to love her unconditionally and so help me God, I’m going to do it. Maybe she’s the answer to why I’m still here.”\n\n\n\n\n\nLiam was born in 2009. His mother, Angie, had struggled with an opioid problem, and had taken Suboxone to combat it during her pregnancy. She told me that she also “might have used” heroin “a couple of times.” At the hospital, Jason felt that something was amiss with his son. His mother, Christine Chalmers, recalled, “He says, ‘Mom, this baby is in withdrawal. They can’t release him—he’s in terrible pain. If we take him home, he’s going to scream and scream and scream, and we won’t have anything to help him.’ ” (Suboxone can cause withdrawal.) “So we called the doctor and, by golly, they checked him over, and he was in total withdrawal. He was on morphine for two solid weeks in the hospital.”\n\n\n\nJason, who grew up in Martinsburg, was a heroin addict for most of his life, a fact that puzzled his family almost as deeply as it saddened them. He grew up in an attractive, wooded development on a country road, with horses and dogs, and a kindhearted mother. His grandparents lived in the development, too, and Jason and his two siblings waited for the school bus together on a wooden bench that a neighbor had carved for them.\n\n\n\nThere were glimmers of an explanation here and there. Jason’s parents had divorced when he was eight, and he was a shy, anxious kid; when he was twenty-five, he was given a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder. His older brother, Michael—the publisher of the Shepherdstown _Observer_—told me, “If you gave us a bag of Reese’s peanut-butter cups when we were kids, Jason would eat fifty of them. I’d eat five. I would’ve _liked_ to eat fifty, but I was, like, ‘Nah, I’ll eat five.’ ” Maybe, Michael suggested, this was evidence that Jason had a genetic predisposition for addiction. But who knew, really?\n\n\n\nIn high school, Jason was “smart, good-looking, and athletic,” Michael recalled, but he became the “king of the stoners.” He barely got his diploma. It was the beginning of a self-destructive pattern. Jason did things while he was on drugs, or trying to get drugs, that filled him with shame; to blot out those feelings, he’d get high again. He got into using heroin, then into selling it. A friend’s father was a dealer, and Jason went to work for him, driving up to New York to procure drugs and driving back to Martinsburg to sell them. He introduced heroin to a girlfriend—a good student who had a scholarship to an excellent university. She dropped out, overdosed, and died. He got a tattoo of the girlfriend’s initials next to a dove, and a tattoo of Jesus, and a tattoo that represented his addiction: a desperate-looking demon with a gaping mouth. He went to jail dozens of times (drug possession, credit-card theft) and had a series of nearly fatal overdoses. In 2002, he stole his grandfather’s checkbook and emptied his bank account. Christine urged her father to press charges, both because she felt that Jason had to be held responsible and because she felt safest—and could actually sleep at night—when he was behind bars. He lied to her, and stole from her, and after using heroin he would pass out on her deck, in her garage, at the end of her driveway.\n\n\n\nJason did not go to college, and he could not keep a job for long; he worked for a few weeks at a mini-mart, but got fired when his background check came in. He’d get clean in jail, and write contrite letters to his family. Then he’d return to Martinsburg and start hanging out again with his addict friends. Michael moved to Chicago to start a career as an advertising copywriter, and their sister, Antonia, went to work for the school system. Jason, now in his thirties, was stuck—walking everywhere because he couldn’t get a driver’s license, and showing up at his mother’s house in the middle of the night to beg for milk and cereal.\n\n\n\nIn 2008, Jason wrote to his grandparents, “If I was a gambling man, which if you look at my track record my whole life has been a gamble, I’d have to say there’s not enough time left in the world to make good on the pain I’ve caused.” He observed, “Damaged people can be dangerous because they know they can survive, but for some reason they don’t know quite how to live.”\n\n\n\nChristine Chalmers had struggled financially to raise three children as a single mother. But in 2002, when Jason was twenty-six, she was doing well as a real-estate agent, and she sent Jason to a monthlong rehab program in Colorado that cost ten thousand dollars. She recalled, “I went after a couple of weeks, for parents’ weekend, and you know what? It was so worth it. He’d been on heroin for ten years at this point, and it was the first time in all that time I saw him like my boy. He says, ‘It’s like a new world, Mom—I can see things, I can smell things, I can feel things.’ ” She paused. “I thought, You know what? If I never have anything else, he had a month, and I had a weekend, and he was my boy.”\n\n\n\nOn April 28, 2014, Jason fatally overdosed. He was thirty-seven. His death did not come as a surprise: he had started telling Christine that the worst part of overdosing was waking up.\n\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F593b695fedb25442b234e9ab]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\nAfter an overdose death, an autopsy is usually performed. Because of the epidemic, coroners in West Virginia are often backed up. It took two weeks before Jason’s body was returned to the Chalmers family. Afterward, Christine thought about how consumed she had been by her attempts to save Jason and, later, to protect his children from him. One day, Michael and Antonia had been cleaning up Jason’s apartment, and they brought over to Christine the contents of his kitchen cabinet. Christine told me, “There were a couple of cans of peas, and I had never served peas—I didn’t like them. And I said, ‘I didn’t know Jason liked peas!’ There’s your boy, your baby, and you never knew he liked peas. Such a simple thing. But I started crying, because I thought, What did we know about him as a _person_?”\n\n\n\nWhen the man who sold Jason his final dose of heroin went on trial, Christine testified. “But, you know, from that point on I have felt terrible about it,” she said. “The guy got ten years. And in some sense his life was saved, because he would have ended up the same as Jase. But when I look at him I know he’d just done the same things Jason did. I mean, who knows who Jase sold to? Who knows who lived or died because he sold to them?”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nChristine, who is now sixty-four, and works full time as a secretary in the Berkeley County government, has found herself raising Jacey, who is in the third grade. (Liam lives with his mother, in another state.) One of the biggest collateral effects of the opioid crisis is the growing number of children being raised by people other than their parents, or being placed in foster care. In West Virginia, the number of children removed from parental care because of drug abuse rose from nine hundred and seventy in 2006 to two thousand one hundred and seventy-one in 2016. Shawn Valentine, a *program director for a nonprofit that helps children navigate foster care*{: .correct}, says that although the goal is to reunite children with their parents, this happens in “less than twenty-five per cent of the cases we are involved in.” A major reason is that parents often can’t get access to recovery programs or medication-assisted treatment, because of waiting lists and financial obstacles.\n\n\n\n\n\nValentine said, “I had a six-year-old once tell me that he had to hold the stretchy thing on his mom’s arm. What would happen if he just didn’t want to do that? He told me, ‘Well, she would smack my head down, so that powdery stuff got all over my face.’ ”\n\n\n\nChristine and Jacey live in Martinsburg, in a pretty bungalow with a porch swing and a glider, and a front door with bright-yellow trim. Down the street, there’s a couple with five adopted children whose parents were addicts. Across the street, a woman named Melissa lives with her elderly father and her youngest sister’s two little boys. Their mother was a heroin addict, and lost custody of the kids two years ago. At the time, Melissa, who is a medical technician at a nursing home, was working and living in Maryland—she is divorced, and her own children are grown. She rushed home to Martinsburg to care for her nephews, whom I’ll call Cody and Aiden.\n\n\n\nOne afternoon, I sat talking with Melissa and Christine on Christine’s front porch, while Jacey and the boys ran around in a ragged, laughing pack. Christine served some brownies that she had baked. Melissa recalled that, when her sister lost custody, her nephews’ caseworker told her that Aiden, who was then a toddler, would be quickly adopted, but that eight-year-old Cody, who bore more obvious signs of trauma, would probably languish in foster care. Melissa said that she couldn’t stand to see them separated. “I was, like, ‘What choice do I have?’ ” she said.\n\n\n\nChristine patted her on the knee. “Good girl,” she said.\n\n\n\nJacey kept a close eye on Aiden, who kept wandering over to the neighbor’s yard, where there was a new Chihuahua puppy.\n\n\n\nChristine said, “The sad thing about it is there are so many of these kids.”\n\n\n\n“Yes!” Melissa said. “Aiden’s pre-K teacher told me forty per cent of the kids in her class are being raised by somebody other than a parent.”\n\n\n\n“That means forty per cent have been found out,” Christine said. “Who knows what’s going on with the other parents?”\n\n\n\nJacey is a bright, curious kid, with pearly pink glasses and a sprinkling of freckles. The first time I met her, she catalogued her accomplishments in gymnastics. “I can do a handstand, a round-off, I’m working on my back handspring,” she said. “I can do a front flip. I want to try a back flip, but it’s kinda hard. I still have a lot more ahead of me.”\n\n\n\nChristine has been honest with Jacey about Jason’s addiction, in the hope that it will keep her from ending up on a similar path. But it would be hard to keep the truth from Jacey: she remembers finding her father’s needles, and she remembers him getting high. He often dropped into a state of suspended animation—still standing, bent over at the waist, head dangling near his knees. Jacey told me that she and Liam used to think it was a game: “It was, like, he’s dead, but he’s also alive. You could tap on him and talk to him—he’d just be snoring there. But you could also feel that he was breathing. We would put our hands up to his nose and we could feel the air coming in and out.”\n\n\n\nLast fall, Jacey won a statewide poster-making contest, called “Kids Kick Opioids,” that was sponsored by the West Virginia attorney general’s office. Jacey’s poster—one of two thousand entries—included a photograph of Jason, in a backward baseball cap and baggy shorts, holding a grinning Liam on one hip and Jacey on the other. She had written a little passage about how much she missed him after he’d “died from taking drugs,” and how she wanted to “hug and kiss him every day.” She wrote, “It is very sad when kids don’t have their daddy to play with.”\n\n\n\nChristine said of the poster, “I think Jason would have wanted it. Jason wanted so badly for people not to follow him.” \n\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F593b69611f743c6ee49a57de]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n\nAt one point, Jacey was lying on the porch floor, drawing a rainbow with some colored pencils, when Christine said she thought that it was wrong to send opioid addicts to prison.\n\n\n\nJacey piped up. “Yeah, but they should take them away from their home town. Also, get them help.”\n\n\n\n“Yes,” Christine said. “Long-term help. A month is not enough.”\n\n\n\n“But take them away from, say, Martinsburg,” Jacey said, looking down at her rainbow. “Maybe take them across the world.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nRecently, Martinsburg has begun to treat the heroin crisis more openly as a public-health problem. The police chief, a Chicago transplant named Maurice Richards, had devised a progressive-sounding plan called the Martinsburg Initiative, which would direct support services toward children who appeared to be at risk for addiction, because their families were struggling socially or emotionally. In December, Tina Stride and several other local citizens stood up at a zoning meeting to proclaim the need for a detox center. They countered several residents who testified that such a center would bring more addicts, and more heroin, to their neighborhoods. “I’m here to say that’s already here,” a woman in favor of the proposal said. “It’s in your neighbor’s house, in the bathroom at Wendy’s, in our schools.” She added, “We’re talking about making America great again? Well, it starts here.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThat night, the Board of Zoning Appeals voted to allow a detox center, run by Peter Callahan, the psychotherapist, to occupy an unused commercial building in town. People in the hearing room cheered and cried and hugged one another. The facility will have only sixteen beds and won’t be ready for patients until December, but the Hope Dealer women were thrilled about it. Now they wouldn’t have to drive halfway across the state every time an addict called them up.\n\n\n\nJohn Aldis, who was sitting next to me during the vote, breathed a sigh of relief. He said later, “It’s like that Winston Churchill quote: ‘This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.’ ”\n\n\n\nThis spring, Berkeley County started its first needle-exchange program, and other efforts are being made to help addicts survive. The new app that first responders are using to document overdoses allows them to input how many times a patient is given Narcan; when multiple doses are required, the heroin tends to be adulterated with strong synthetics. Such data can help the health department and law enforcement track dangerous batches of drugs, and help warn addicts.\n\n\n\nSome Martinsburg residents who had been skeptical of medication-assisted treatment told me that they were coming around to the idea. A few cited the Surgeon General’s report on substance abuse, released in November, which encouraged the expansion of such treatment, noting that studies have repeatedly demonstrated its efficacy in “reducing illicit drug use and overdose deaths.” In Berkeley County, it felt like a turning point, though the Trump Administration was likely to resist such approaches. Tom Price, the new Secretary of Health and Human Services, has dismissed medication-assisted treatment as “substituting one opioid for another.” It was also unclear how most addicts would pay for treatment if the Affordable Care Act was repealed.\n\n\n\nMartinsburg residents, meanwhile, tried to take heart from small breakthroughs. Angel Holt, the mother who’d overdosed at the softball practice, told me that she and her boyfriend had stayed clean since that day, and she was hoping to regain custody of her children. She’d been helped by the kindness of an older couple, Karen and Ed Schildt, who lived in Thurmont, Maryland. A year earlier, the Schildts had lost their twenty-five-year-old son, Chris, to a heroin overdose. They were deeply religious, and when they heard what happened to Angel Holt and Christopher Schildt they decided to reach out to them. The fact that their son had the same name as Holt’s boyfriend surely meant that God had put the couple in their path. Karen texted Holt words of encouragement almost daily.\n\n\n\nIn February, I spent an afternoon with Shawn Valentine, the *nonprofit program director*{: .correct}, who introduced me to Shelby, her twenty-five-year-old daughter. Shelby had become addicted to opioids at twenty-one, when she was depressed and waitressing at a Waffle House. Her co-workers always seemed to know how to get their hands on pills. When the meds got too expensive, Shelby turned to heroin.\n\n\n\nShelby, Valentine, and I were sitting in Valentine’s kitchen, along with Shelby’s sweet fifteen-year-old brother, Patrick. Shelby said, “People don’t realize what the brain goes through when you’re addicted—it’s like a mental shutdown. Everything is gray. You have these blinders on.” As she described it, the constant hunt for heroin imposed a kind of order on life’s confounding open-endedness. Addiction told you what every day was for, when otherwise you might not have known.\n\n\n\nFor close to a year, Shelby had been in a program in which she put a dissolvable strip of Suboxone on her tongue every day, and attended group and individual therapy. (The word “assisted” in “medication-assisted treatment” indicates the primacy of the need for recovering addicts to figure out why they are drawn to opioids.) Shelby said that Suboxone helped curb her craving for heroin, without sedating her. “There are triggers,” she said. “But the urge to run a hundred yards down the street and try to find my ex-dealer and pay him, then shove a used rig in my arm real quick? That’s gone.”\n\n\n\nShe can now be trusted not to sell treasured things for drug money: her little brother’s video-game console, her mom’s four-leaf-clover necklace. Her long auburn hair, which she used to wash and comb so seldom that her mother once spent four hours trying to untangle it, is now silky and soft. \n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F59277ad49e60ea0b7a7f2691]|||\n\nIn tight-knit Appalachian towns, heroin has become a social contagion. Peter Callahan, a psychotherapist in Martinsburg, said, “If the lady next door is using, and so are other neighbors, and people in your family are, too, the odds are good that you’re going to join in.” *Photograph by Eugene Richards for The New Yorker*{: .credit}\n\n|||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nValentine told me that, if Shelby had to be on Suboxone all her life, “I’m absolutely on board with that.” She turned to Shelby. “Whatever it takes for you to be a healthy, productive human being.”\n\n\n\nRecently, Shelby’s mother told her, “O.K., I’ll let you take the truck without me, to take your brother to the movies.” Shelby recalled, “I was almost, like, ‘Pinch me, wake me up—this can’t be true.’ Because without her truck there’s no working. That’s how she makes her living. She said, ‘Here’s a piece of trust. Don’t throw it away.’ ”\n\n\n\nShelby and her brother drove to the mall and saw a horror movie. It was not a very good one, they agreed, but it didn’t matter. They headed home in the dark, and the moment they got there Shelby placed the keys to the truck in her mother’s hand. ♦\n\n\n\nShawn Valentine’s title has been updated to clarify her role in the

In the hours before they lost consciousness, they had been sluggish and dopey, struggling to stay awake. A few had complained of chest pain. “I can’t catch my breath,” one kept saying. All of them had taken painkillers prescribed by a family practice called the Schneider Medical Clinic.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe clinic was in Haysville, a working-class suburb of Wichita. The main industries in the area were aircraft and plastics, neither of which was doing well. A mile south of the clinic, there was little except wheat fields. The chief doctor was Stephen Schneider, a fifty-one-year-old osteopath with sandy hair and dimples. He treated the county commissioner and the chief of police, gave physicals to the boys at the Haysville high school, and did rounds at local nursing homes. One of his patients, Jeffrey Peters, told me that Schneider reminded him of the “kind of family doctor we had forty years ago, when I was growing up—a doctor who will sit down and listen to you and joke around and make you feel comfortable.”\n\n\n\nOn September 13, 2005, Schneider arrived at work to find the clinic cordoned off with police tape. He called his wife, Linda Atterbury, a blond, peppy forty-seven-year-old nurse, who was at home with their two young daughters, and told her to come to work. Agents from the Kansas Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration led Schneider into one of the clinic’s fourteen exam rooms and asked him why he had been prescribing so many opioid painkillers. He responded that sixty per cent of his patients suffered from chronic pain, and few other physicians in the area would treat them. The agents wrote, “He tries to believe his patients when they describe their health problems and he will believe them until they prove themselves wrong.” When asked how many of his patients had died, Schneider said that he didn’t know.\n\n\n\nAfter the raid, fifty patients signed a petition that said, “We stand united in support of Dr. Schneider.” A receptionist hung a banner on the front of the clinic, and patients scrawled appreciative notes on it. The Schneiders also received numerous letters from patients. One wrote, “I believe that you have saved my life many times. Sometimes just by listening.” A woman with a connective-tissue disease explained, “If you have never lived with chronic pain, you have absolutely nothing to say. . . . Chronic pain changes who you are. Without the medications I am on I have no life left!”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nSchneider hadn’t thought of becoming a doctor until 1979, when his three-year-old daughter, Leigh Anne, developed pneumonia. She was confined to an oxygen tent for a month. He thought the hospital was a “neat and fantastic atmosphere.” At the time, he was next in line to become the manager of the meat department at Dillons, a local grocery store. He had imagined working there with his first wife, who was a cashier, for the rest of his life. But, once his daughter recovered, he enrolled at Wichita State University and, in 1983, became the first person in his family to graduate from college.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter his first wife left him, Schneider married Atterbury, who was drawn to what she called his “animal heart”—his tenderness toward pets, children, and the elderly. She encouraged him to apply to medical school, even though she worried that a “professional that high up may get a big head.” At the University of Health Sciences, a school of osteopathy in Kansas City, Schneider felt alienated by what he called the “Dr. God feeling.” He found some of his attending physicians “demanding and demeaning to patients and nurses.” Leigh Anne, who is now a doctor, told me that her father was “never comfortable with the level of status” that came with the job.\n\n\n\nIn 1995, the Schneiders adopted two girls, both toddlers, from an orphanage in Câmpulung, Romania, and raised them on a plot of land that Atterbury’s parents owned, in Haysville. Her parents and three siblings lived in houses surrounding a wheat field. Atterbury had been raised on the Midwestern carnival circuit. Her aunt was a trapeze artist, her grandfather owned a circus known for its elephant, and her father ran concession and game stands. Atterbury believed that her upbringing made her tougher and more discriminating than Schneider. She liked to joke, “My husband believes everybody, I believe nobody, so we kind of equal each other out.” \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F593b5db73adc75471b34b0ab]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nSchneider was hired by Riverside Hospital, in Wichita, to work at a small subsidiary clinic in Haysville. In a letter of recommendation, one of his mentors wrote that he had “the highest moral character.” Most people in town, including Atterbury and her family, referred to him as Doc. He treated routine ailments, like rashes, colds, and diabetes. Several patients came to him with chronic-pain conditions, but he didn’t feel comfortable prescribing opioids long-term, so he referred those patients to specialists in Wichita.\n\n\n\nAfter Schneider had worked for the clinic for thirteen years, Riverside was bought by a larger hospital system, and he and his new employer couldn’t agree on a contract. In 2001, he set up a makeshift office at an optometry clinic. It was so small that people would bring lawn chairs and wait for their appointments in the parking lot.\n\n\n\nHe was at the optometry clinic for only a few months before he and his wife took out a two-million-dollar loan to build a larger medical center. Atterbury, who would manage the office, said that she found an “architect to build my dream for him.” The clinic, which had its own X-ray room and blood lab, was designed in the Pueblo Revival style, with tan stucco walls, two fountains, and a sky dome. Schneider asked a Catholic priest to bless the property and sprinkle the ground with holy water. He envisioned an alternative to the emergency room: the clinic would be open seven days a week, and all patients could be seen the day they called. He recruited three physician assistants and a family doctor, as well as a cardiologist and a spine surgeon, who would visit the clinic once a week. The Haysville _Times_ featured a photograph of the mayor of Haysville, the chief of police, and Schneider, in white construction hats, standing in front of a billboard that said, “Future Site of Dr. Schneider.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nSchneider was one of the few doctors in the area to readily accept Medicaid, which, he said, reimbursed less than a fifth of the cost of his appointments, and he quickly attracted a large population of patients who were on disability. Many suffered from lower-back pain after years spent assembling aircraft machinery. In medical school, Schneider had been taught that opioids were so addictive that patients should not be prescribed them unless they were dying, but the thinking in the field had evolved. Doctors began using opioids more liberally in the seventies, after the emergence of the palliative-care movement, the first branch of medicine to make the relief of suffering its primary aim. In the eighties, physicians treating patients who had cancer (whether or not it was terminal) prescribed opioids more freely, too. A 1989 article in the _New England Journal of Medicine_ stated, “To allow a patient to experience unbearable pain or suffering is unethical medical practice.”\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the nineties, this ethos was being applied to all kinds of pain. In 1995, the American Pain Society, an organization of health professionals across disciplines, recommended that doctors consider pain the “fifth vital sign,” monitoring it as regularly as they measure pulse.\n\n\n\nSchneider said that, when he opened his own practice, “pharmaceutical reps came in and enlightened me that it was O.K. to treat chronic pain, because there is no real cure. They had all sorts of studies showing that the long-acting medications were appropriate.” In 2002, shortly after the clinic opened, a pharmaceutical representative from Purdue Pharma, which produces OxyContin, arranged for Schneider and Jon Parks, a pain doctor in Wichita, to have dinner at a steak house. Parks described his practice and gave Schneider a copy of his pain-management contract, which required his patients to submit to urine tests. Schneider distributed the contract to his own patients and, with little training, began treating chronic pain. When a Wichita pharmacist asked Schneider if he would be willing to take all the pain patients of a local family doctor who had recently died, Schneider said, “Sure, just send them over.”\n\n\n\nLike most doctors, Schneider asked his patients to rate their pain on a scale from one to ten (“pain as bad as it can be”). Many patients scored their pain a ten or ten-plus, and complained that they felt emasculated or useless, and often depressed. Schneider said, “The aircraft industry, like any industry, wears out its people.” But he did find himself wondering why his patients seemed to have become “wimpier.” They were no longer willing to endure any pain; they wanted it instantly eradicated. Schneider occasionally referred them to physical therapists or anesthesiologists, but for the most part he gave them the relief they requested. In a letter of thanks to Schneider, one patient wrote, “I call you the pick-up doctor, why? Because after these other doctors screw your life up from negligence in surgery (like the disc on my back), they do not want to bother with you anymore. So you get referred to Dr. Schneider.” \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F593b5db93adc75471b34b0ad]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nPain is inadequately treated, particularly among the poor and the mentally ill, in part because there are lingering doubts about whether such a subjective experience is proportional or “real.” Bob Twillman, the founder of the inpatient pain-management program at the University of Kansas Medical Center and the director of policy and advocacy for the American Academy of Pain Management, told me, “The system is not well designed to treat these patients. What you end up with is a primary-care doctor who is stuck wanting to do something for his patients but doesn’t have the resources to do much of anything but write another prescription.” Although about a hundred million Americans suffer from chronic pain, according to a recent report by the Institute of Medicine, medical schools devote, on average, only nine hours to pain, and only about four thousand physicians are board-certified as pain specialists. Twillman said that he knew few doctors in Wichita who were willing to accept “all the hassle and uncertainty associated with chronic pain.” He sensed that Schneider was “trying to do the right thing,” and he referred patients to him.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn its first full year, the Schneider Medical Clinic took in $1.37 million in patient fees, and had a net income of two hundred and twenty thousand dollars. There was often a sign in the lobby informing patients that there would be at least a two-hour wait. Atterbury knocked on the doors of exam rooms if she thought that clinicians were spending too much time with their patients. When the chairs in the waiting room filled, patients sat on the edge of the fountains or milled about under the portico. Appointments were generally scheduled every ten minutes. Justin Brawner, a machine operator with a herniated disk, told me that in the waiting room some patients nodded off in their chairs. Others were sweaty, jittery, and irritable. He observed patients who moved freely until they were called into the doctor’s office, at which point they developed an exaggerated limp. Brawner said that he heard them “planning their tactics.” They’d make up stories about how they needed extra pills because they were leaving the state or their medication had slipped into the sink. Brawner asked for early refills, too. Schneider would chide him for coming in too soon and then say, “We’re going to go ahead and write the script, because I know you need it.”\n\n\n\n\n\nSchneider didn’t socialize much with other doctors. He felt that many of them were sheltered and “didn’t know how to talk to real people.” He almost always took his patients’ side when they complained about doctors who had “discriminated” against them for needing opioids. Schneider told me, “I don’t even know the actual quote for the Hippocratic Oath, but aren’t you doing harm if there’s a treatment for something and you refuse to use it?”\n\n\n\nHis patients’ numbers descended on the pain scale, but their ability to function normally did, too; several quit their jobs, applying for disability with Schneider’s help. When family members questioned the amount of opioids that their loved ones were taking, Schneider assured them that everything would be fine. A recent college graduate who accompanied his depressed mother to appointments said that he repeatedly asked if she should see a psychiatrist. Schneider told him, he said, that the sadness would subside with the pain: “There’s a light at the end of the tunnel—you’ll see it. I’ve brought people back from this before.” The patient eventually killed herself. Her son said that the problem wasn’t that Schneider was deceptive; it was that he was “so flipping happy.”\n\n\n\nNearly a dozen sales representatives from pharmaceutical companies came to Schneider’s office each day. They took him out for meals, sent him to seminars and conferences, and gave him free samples and gifts. Schneider’s cluttered office contained a Lexapro clock, Viagra pens, and a cup featuring the logo for Nasonex nasal spray. The clinic never had to buy its own tissues, because drug companies contributed boxes branded with their name. Atterbury wondered how physicians could stay grounded when the pharmaceutical representatives were always flattering them. She said, “They treat the doctors like they are above everyone else, listening to them, catering to them, dressing well for them, saying, ‘Where do you want to eat tonight?’ ” \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F593b5dbb20855957e69d52d3]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nAfter listening to presentations by the company Cephalon, Schneider became one of the few family physicians in Wichita to regularly prescribe Actiq, a raspberry-flavored lollipop that contains fentanyl, which is eighty times more potent than morphine. The Food and Drug Administration has approved Actiq only for acute cancer pain, but Cephalon’s pharmaceutical representatives, who called themselves “pain-care specialists,” told Schneider that it worked well for all sorts of pain, particularly migraines. Although it’s legal for doctors to prescribe medications for uses that have not been approved by the F.D.A., pharmaceutical companies are prohibited from marketing drugs for such purposes. According to whistleblower suits later filed against the company (and settled, in 2008, for more than four hundred million dollars), the “pain-care specialists” sought out doctors who did not treat cancer. They were instructed to respond to questions about off-label use of the drugs by saying, “Yes, we are indicated for cancer pain, but wouldn’t you agree that pain is pain?” The company sent Schneider’s physician assistant to New York for an “Actiq consultants meeting”; it paid for her to stay at the W hotel and to ride a boat on the Hudson. In 2003, Schneider was sent to an Actiq conference in New Orleans, sponsored by Cephalon. He said that a specialist there told him, “You could stick multiple Actiq suckers in your mouth and your rear end and you still wouldn’t overdose. It’s clinically impossible.”\n\n\n\nThree years after his clinic opened, Schneider attended the first meeting of the Sedgwick County Pain Society, a group of doctors and law-enforcement officers working to minimize the abuse of prescription drugs. Schneider was one of the first people to speak, and he asked if anyone would be willing to take some of his Medicaid pain patients. He told me that all the doctors in the area had taken the “good insurance patients” and given him their leftovers, the ones with multiple illnesses and unreliable histories. Gregory Lakin, a family physician and a former prosecutor who runs the largest addiction-treatment center in Kansas, was moderating the meeting, and he asked for a show of hands. There were twenty doctors, nurses, and physician assistants in the room, but no one volunteered to take any of Schneider’s patients. “I felt embarrassed about it,” Lakin told me. He had previously accepted Medicaid, and he did not want to do it again. He told me, “I do think Steve had a little bit of the martyr in him. He’s isolated, being in a small town, and he saw himself as a rescuer, a savior of the downtrodden, and that overrode his ability to assess the warning signs.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn the fall of 2004, FirstGuard, a Kansas Medicaid contractor, told the Schneider Clinic that it was concerned about its quality of care, particularly its off-label prescriptions of Actiq. FirstGuard’s medical director visited the clinic and later told the D.E.A. that his “over-all impression” was that it was a “sophisticated practice with gaps in its process, but making an effort to serve” an area in which there were few medical services. He also thought that the clinicians “needed to be better educated.” (Since 2011, the F.D.A. has required doctors to get extra training before prescribing rapid-onset opioids, like Actiq.)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response, the clinic recruited a nurse practitioner to perform psychological evaluations once a month, but patients didn’t show up for her visits, and after a few months the nurse stopped coming. Schneider guessed that patients skipped her visits because “they didn’t want to be thought of as nuts.” The clinic also tightened its policies, requiring patients to submit to pill counts and frequent urine tests. But the clinic’s records were so chaotic that clinicians occasionally ended up seeing patients without their charts. A few times, when there was a long line of patients, Atterbury reportedly instructed medical assistants to copy whatever vital signs had been marked during the previous visit, rather than perform the tests again. There was one fax machine for more than ten thousand patients. When the coroner’s office called the clinic to request records for a deceased patient, Atterbury took the calls and, according to one receptionist’s testimony, didn’t always relay the news to her husband. She was in charge of hiring decisions, and she gravitated toward single women who were struggling. “I hire misfits,” she told the agents who investigated the clinic. “I’m like the mother to all these single women. . . . I take care of most of my girls there because they can’t make it in the real world.” The administrative staff had a high turnover, and Atterbury ended up hiring six members of her family, as well as an illegal immigrant whom she had met on a trip to Mexico and called her “adopted son.”\n\n\n\nThe clinic “fired” more than nine hundred patients for misusing their drugs. But discharged patients often returned to the clinic and requested to see a new provider, who would unknowingly prescribe the prohibited medications again. The clinic began putting the medical records of terminated patients in bright-red folders. When some patients were discharged, they became belligerent, yelling at the providers, throwing soda cans, or spitting in their faces. The physician assistant Kim Hébert later testified that she called the local police more than twenty times. “Patients threatened to stalk me, patients threatened to cut me up in multiple pieces, patients threatened harm on my family,” she said. Schneider offered to bring a can of Mace to work. Hébert described Schneider as a “gentleman,” a “good person,” but she thought that he was too laid-back. He was so proud of the clinic and of his wife, whose management decisions he deferred to, that he was unable, or unwilling, to reflect on its flaws. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F593b5dbd57b86d47b169c18d]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nPatients from the clinic were often admitted to the emergency room at Wesley Medical Center, in Wichita. Schneider’s daughter, Leigh Anne, who was doing her residency there, said that doctors would “roll their eyes and say, ‘Oh, that’s another Schneider patient. He’s probably a drug-seeker.’ ” Leigh Anne said that her father was “so naïve” about his wife’s ability to manage the clinic. She said, “He is insanely in love with her, and always has been,” adding, “I have a whole list of drugs I would never prescribe, because you need to know so much.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nOpioids are unique among medications, because there is no maximum dose. Unlike painkillers such as aspirin or Tylenol, consuming large quantities is unlikely to permanently damage the organs. In 2001, the Joint Commission, which accredits health-care organizations around the country, urged doctors to recognize that subjective reports of pain should be the standard upon which interventions are based. The Joint Commission’s guidebook to pain management, which was sponsored by Purdue Pharma, suggested that doctors have been operating under exaggerated and outdated fears of addiction, and says that if patients became tolerant of the medications the dose could be increased.\n\n\n\n\n\nSchneider taught the providers at his clinic to prescribe “whatever it takes to improve function and quality of life without sedating.” When a former cocaine addict and exotic dancer named Kandace came to the Schneider Clinic after spine surgery, in 2003, complaining that “every bone in my body feels crushed,” she was prescribed, at various times, OxyContin, Actiq, and a Duragesic patch, which releases fentanyl through the skin. Months later, Kandace complained to Kim Hébert that her pain was still “out of control.” Hébert had just been to a seminar called “Kadian Connect,” sponsored by the pharmaceutical company Faulding, and she gave Kandace a voucher for Kadian, a long-acting morphine.\n\n\n\nKandace began taking the drug immediately, even though the other medications were still in her blood. Later that day, Kandace’s mother noticed that Kandace’s thinking was “kind of foggy.” The next day, Kandace complained to her mother of chest pain, and a few hours later she died in her sleep. Hébert went to the funeral, and, the next time she saw the Kadian pharmaceutical representative, she told him about the death and said that she was “not interested in hearing about his product.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn 2002, Asa Hutchinson, the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, told members of the American Pain Society that the agency had been tracking the proliferation of opioids and had seen a shift from “recreational abuse to addiction.” While acknowledging that the “D.E.A. does not intend to play the role of doctor,” Hutchinson said that the agency would target “unscrupulous medical professionals.” Later that year, a report by the Department of Justice’s inspector general found that only ten per cent of D.E.A. field investigators were addressing the abuse of prescription painkillers. The report recommended that the agency devote far more resources to the problem, employing the same tactics used to catch drug dealers: undercover agents, surveillance, and confidential informants.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe D.E.A.’s new campaign stood in uneasy relation to the medical establishment’s move to treat pain more aggressively. The D.E.A. began investigating about six hundred and fifty doctors a year, particularly those at “pill mills”—clinics where doctors sell drugs in exchange for cash, with little regard for the practice of medicine—but the agency’s tactics did little to slow drug abuse. Deaths from opioids have quadrupled in the past ten years. Prescription drugs contribute to half of all deaths by overdose, accounting for more fatalities than heroin and cocaine combined. The D.E.A.’s efforts represent a costly and baroque way of addressing only a small, anomalous piece of the problem. The agency has cracked down on the part of the supply chain that is out in the open and easiest to reach. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, less than twenty per cent of people who misuse painkillers received them from doctors. The majority borrowed, bought, or stole the drugs from relatives, friends, or dealers. When doctors prescribe too many opioids, it is not typically because they are corrupt; more often, they are rushed, uninformed, or concerned about their patient-satisfaction ratings. In rural regions, where there are few specialists, opioids become a default solution: unlike psychological or physical therapies, which are poorly reimbursed, writing a prescription is cheap and quick.\n\n\n\nAfter the Schneider Medical Clinic was raided, in September, 2005, Atterbury discouraged her husband from continuing to see pain patients. But he told her, “We are doing the right thing—we don’t have to be fearful.” Schneider was under the impression that there had been fewer than a dozen deaths, and that nearly all of these patients had abused their medications. He said, “It hurt me that they were pulling the wool over my eyes.” There was only one patient whose death had shaken him deeply, a woman named Robin, who had been taking Actiq as prescribed. “I still have a hard time believing she overdosed,” he told me. “She was a fantastic person. I really loved her.” \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F593b5dbe3adc75471b34b0b3]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nFollowing news reports of the raid, several patients filed malpractice suits, and three clinicians resigned. Schneider decided to sell the clinic, but, as he waited for a buyer, he went on treating patients, mostly those with chronic pain, because his other patients found new doctors. With a diminished staff, Schneider didn’t have enough time to see all of his patients in one day. Sometimes there were so many people lined up in the morning that Atterbury told the D.E.A. agents, “I felt like we were selling concert tickets.”\n\n\n\nIn March, 2006, there was a second raid, which seemed never to end. Although the clinic remained open, federal agents kept returning to pull more charts. The Schneiders became accustomed to officers following them. They noticed agents parked at the car wash across from the clinic, and on a side street near their home. Their daughter Zoyie, who was fourteen, said that an agent stood in the back of the church while her family attended a Sunday service. Atterbury’s sister, Pat, who runs a funnel-cake business, said that she was alarmed when a man in a van, with a computer on his lap, was parked in front of her house for several hours. “It was like they were waiting for the Mexicans to ride on their horses into Linda’s yard,” Pat told me.\n\n\n\nThe D.E.A. sent at least one undercover officer to the clinic to request heavy quantities of painkillers. The recording is barely audible, but Schneider’s voice can be heard giving instructions for using a Duragesic patch. The fake patient said that she wanted Actiq, too, but he told her, “I like to only do one thing at a time. . . . So try the Duragesic patch. . . . And then the next time we can talk about that possibility.” He gave her Percocet for breakthrough pain, and, when she asked for a higher dose, he refused and then laughed, seemingly embarrassed by the interaction. “I mean, I just don’t want to get you into a stupor,” he told her. “I don’t want you to be a zombie or anything.”\n\n\n\nOn December 19, 2007, the Schneiders and their two children spent the day doing Christmas errands. For hours, an unmarked police car followed them. The Schneiders said they took several wrong turns while trying to find a clothing shop, and then left the store immediately. The agents concluded that the family was attempting to evade them, and decided that they were a flight risk. Later that day, the Schneiders went to a friend’s house and took family pictures. As they were pulling out of the driveway, two cars blocked their way.\n\n\n\nSchneider and Atterbury were taken to the county jail, where Schneider recognized, among the inmates, two of his former patients. He and his wife were charged with causing the deaths of three people through the unlawful distribution of controlled substances—a charge that carries a mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years. The indictment described the Schneider Clinic as a “narcotics delivery system” and linked it to the deaths of sixty-eight patients. In addition to the opioid-overdose deaths, there were patients who had died after mixing their painkillers with street drugs or alcohol, or after taking pills from friends who had been patients of Schneider’s. Others had heart disease, which made their heavy use of narcotics lethal. Schneider said that he found the charges so confusing that he made it through only a few passages of the sixty-page indictment. “I started, but it appeared terrible,” he said. “I couldn’t read that.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAfter Schneider’s arrest, the Sedgwick County Medical Society was overwhelmed by calls from former patients requesting referrals. The society held a meeting to discuss what to do about Schneider’s patients, who complained in letters to him that no one wanted them. Jon Parks, the Wichita pain specialist, said he told the doctors at the meeting, “There has always been a Dr. Schneider in our community.” He said that doctors in the area dealt with chronic pain inappropriately, by administering nerve blocks, one of the few forms of pain treatment that were reimbursed well. “These doctors stick needles in, take their cash, and run,” he said. When the procedures failed, patients were on their own, and ended up in Haysville. He said to the doctors, “No offense, but this is self-wrought.”\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge Watson, formerly the chief of staff at Riverside Medical Center, in Wichita, wrote a letter to the Kansas Board of Healing Arts, explaining that Schneider “sees the rejects of medicine that *WE*{: .small} won’t see. He sees the people who have had all the surgeries and epidural steroid injections that insurance would buy, before it ran out, *AND*{: .small} they still have pain.” \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F593b5dc020855957e69d52db]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nAlthough Schneider had never been interested in politics, he found himself adopting his patients’ rhetoric about their “right to pain relief,” a notion that has been championed by leading pain doctors. In a widely cited 2007 paper in _Anesthesia & Analgesia_, three scholars wrote that “the unreasonable failure to treat pain is poor medicine, unethical practice, and is an abrogation of a fundamental human right.” One of the co-authors, Daniel Carr, the director of the Pain Research, Education, and Policy program at the Tufts University School of Medicine, told me that people have misinterpreted this statement to mean that patients have the right to narcotics rather than the right to thoughtful and competent care. “Opioids are a tiny little piece of pain management,” he said.\n\n\n\nAlthough opioids are beneficial when taken for less than three months, studies of long-term use show that the drugs, while they may relieve pain, do little to improve function. Those who take the drugs for the longest periods of time, and in the heaviest doses, tend to be patients with psychiatric and substance-abuse disorders—a phenomenon that Mark Sullivan, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Washington, has called “adverse selection.” Sullivan told me that in poor, rural regions doctors are using opioids to treat a “complex mixture of physical and emotional distress.” He said, “It’s much more convenient for both patient and physician to speak in the language of physical pain, which is less stigmatized than psychological pain.” Some of these patients could be said to be suffering from what his colleague calls “terribly-sad-life syndrome.” “These patients are at a dead end, life has stymied them, they are hurting,” he said. “They want to be numb.” He believes that doctors are inappropriately adopting a “palliative-care mentality” to “relieve the suffering of people who have had very tough lives.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nTwo months after the Schneiders’ arrest, Siobhan Reynolds, the president of the Pain Relief Network, an advocacy organization in New Mexico, moved to Wichita. She told the Schneiders that the case was “going to be the big one,” her “chance of a lifetime.” Reynolds’s late husband had suffered from a connective-tissue disorder, an extremely painful condition, and his doctor, William Hurwitz, had been imprisoned in 2004 for excessively prescribing opioids. Reynolds’s husband died two years later, of a brain hemorrhage, which she believed was induced by elevated blood pressure caused by his pain. Testifying before a House Judiciary subcommittee in 2007, she declared that the “D.E.A.’s actions have served to warn the rest of the medical community not to treat serious pain in all its forms.”\n\n\n\n\n\nReynolds did not have a degree in law—her background was in theatre—but the Schneiders let her pick their defense team and rented an apartment for her and the attorneys in Wichita, next to the courthouse. While Atterbury was in jail, her sister, Pat, told her on the phone, “Your guardian angel showed up.” Pat explained that Reynolds had been fighting for prosecuted doctors around the country. “She is so much like us,” Pat said. “She is a spitfire.”\n\n\n\nIn another telephone call, Pat explained that “she’s calling this a play. She says she’s putting all the people in their positions to do the play.”\n\n\n\nReynolds erected a billboard on the central highway in Wichita that said, “Dr. Schneider Never Killed Anyone.” When one of Schneider’s pain patients was admitted to the emergency room, Reynolds organized a vigil at a Walgreens across from the hospital. Six people stood outside, praying and singing. A Schneider patient who was treated for back pain after a car accident said that she became disillusioned with the Pain Relief Network on the night of the vigil, when another patient tried to sell her his Klonopin.\n\n\n\nLess than two months after the billboard went up, Tanya Treadway, an assistant U.S. Attorney, initiated a grand-jury investigation into the Pain Relief Network, which she accused of obstructing justice. Reynolds and the defense team’s paralegal were served with subpoenas requiring that they turn over all correspondence with the Schneiders and their patients. Reynolds refused, arguing that her First Amendment rights were being violated, and that the prosecution was trying to intimidate potential witnesses. Reynolds was fined two hundred dollars a day for four months before she agreed to turn over the documents. By the time the trial began, in April of 2010, the Pain Relief Network was insolvent.\n\n\n\nTreadway did not disclose the grounds for the grand-jury investigation, which remains sealed. She had already asked the judge to issue a gag order preventing the Pain Relief Network from communicating with the media. It was refused. A former high-school teacher, Treadway began crying when she discussed the deaths. She said that the Schneider patients fell into two groups. “There were patients who absolutely loved Dr. Schneider and believed in him and thought he was a wonderful doctor and person,” she said, “and there were patients who thought he was the Devil incarnate.” \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F593b5dc21260cf20873dfd6e]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nAt a hearing, the judge, Monti Belot, expressed concern that Treadway had “overcharged this case.” In a phone conversation with her boss, he spoke of the “oppressive nature of this prosecution” and recommended that Treadway be more closely supervised. In her preparation, Treadway used the depositions taken by Larry Wall, the attorney handling most of the malpractice cases, who was similarly emotionally invested; both his brother and his son, who have since died, struggled with addictions. Wall said, “I know survivors of the heroin epidemic of the seventies, and, when they found out about the Schneider case, they said, ‘It’s going to create a legacy of death for years to come. People will try and fail to kick their addictions.’ ”\n\n\n\nThe Schneiders’ defense team was ill-equipped to counter all the evidence that the prosecution had collected. They seemed to hope that they could win based on a theoretical argument about the inaccessibility of pain care to people without good insurance. Atterbury’s lawyer, Kevin Byers, who was romantically involved with Reynolds, opened the trial by declaring that the case was about “chronic pain treatment, propriety of it, the availability or unavailability of it in America.” Schneider’s lawyer (who has since left the field to become a screenwriter) filed a motion to have the jury leave the courtroom and tour the Schneider Medical Clinic. The motion was denied, but the Schneiders were convinced that once people saw the facility they would realize that it didn’t house a criminal enterprise.\n\n\n\nTreadway told the jury that the clinic “looks a little like a Mexican restaurant. And, much like a Mexican restaurant, people lined up at the front door waiting to get in.” She said that the Schneiders “created an environment where their need for volume, their choice of quantity over quality, simply left no time to practice medicine.” She argued that the Schneiders were in such a rush to make a profit that they treated overdoses as “acceptable casualties.”\n\n\n\nSeven weeks of testimony established Atterbury as an irresponsible and imperious manager, while employees who had known Schneider for years testified that he didn’t want to hear bad news. After learning of an overdose death, he told a physician assistant, “We are doing a good job. . . . We are going to attract the wrong crowd, but . . . when you get a bunch of grapes, you’re going to have some bad grapes and we’re going to have to weed them out.”\n\n\n\nMuch of the testimony was devoted to reëxamining the death of Robin, a forty-five-year-old woman with chronic migraines, who had visited numerous specialists before coming to the Schneider Clinic. She was prescribed a hundred and sixty Actiq suckers a month and became increasingly tolerant of the drug; eventually her dose was doubled. In August, 2006, she wrote a letter to Schneider, thanking him. “You prescribed medicine for me that I had not ever heard of,” she wrote. “From that day on I have received my life back.”\n\n\n\nHer husband testified that, after two years of improvement, Robin became too sleepy to socialize; she slurred her words, and, a few times, for no reason, she spoke with a British accent. After she died, beside him in bed, he sued the clinic for malpractice, but Robin’s mother, Phyllis Rowland, refused to participate in the lawsuit. At the trial, she testified on behalf of the defense. “I know how bad the pain was before she was at Schneider’s,” she said.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nOn the way to the courthouse each morning, Atterbury said, she was “amazed at how many people would drive by and yell out their window and honk their horn and say, ‘Good luck Doc.’ ” Their lawyers assured them that they were winning. “They didn’t want to pop the top of the bubbly, but they were pretty giddy,” Atterbury wrote to me. But Schneider said that he had little hope once he heard the evidence against him. He was “horrified” when he heard the testimony of the defense’s expert witness, whom Reynolds had chosen. The witness insisted that it was impossible to tell whether patients had died of overdoses or of underlying heart diseases, a line of argument that Schneider found strained. It upset him every time his practice was called a “pain clinic,” since his primary concern had always been family medicine.\n\n\n\n\n\nSchneider and Atterbury waited at home for seven days while the jury deliberated. They weren’t sure their wedding rings would meet prison regulations, so, just in case, Schneider went to Kmart and bought two simple gold bands. Atterbury was making dinner when her lawyers called to say that the jury had reached a verdict. As Schneider drove to the courthouse, she and their two daughters bowed their heads and prayed. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F593b5dc420855957e69d52df]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nThey were both found guilty. Schneider was sentenced to thirty years in prison and Atterbury to thirty-three. The judge, Monti Belot, said, “I have the distinct belief that had she not been involved in the operation of the clinic, or had she approached her role there in a professional and responsible way, none of us would be here.” He criticized the Kansas Board of Healing Arts for insufficiently investigating the clinic, the Pain Relief Network (“a ship of fools if there ever was one”), and the doctors in the community, who never reported their concerns. Belot acknowledged that drug-seekers are savvy about inventing their symptoms, but he said that Schneider had plenty of time to learn about their deceptions. He concluded that Schneider deserved a harsher punishment than ordinary drug dealers, because they have “no duty or obligation, legal or otherwise, to do no harm to their customers.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nSchneider was sent to the Forrest City Federal Correctional Complex, in Arkansas, and Atterbury to a prison in Connecticut and then to an institution in Texas. They can’t speak to each other on the phone, but they write each other several letters every week. Letters to friends are often signed “Linda & Steve,” no matter who wrote them. “If they could just put us together in the same cell, we would be good forever,” Atterbury told me.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly this spring, I visited Schneider in prison. His hair was thinning, and his mustache had turned gray. When I said that Atterbury had asked me to buy a Diet Coke for him, he smiled, shook his head, and said, “She is the gas that makes me go.”\n\n\n\nSchneider’s friends say that he was too trusting, a justification that I viewed with skepticism until Schneider began talking about the prison culture. “It’s surprising how nice these inmates are,” he told me. “It’s almost unbelievable, the camaraderie. People act like they’re in gangs, but I can’t say I ever felt I was in jeopardy. The blacks associate with whites, the whites with Mexicans.”\n\n\n\nSchneider worked as a clerk in the library, earning about forty cents an hour. Twenty-five dollars was taken out of his paycheck every three months and paid into a restitution fund for his victims. He was hurt when he read his patients’ claims. “I had no idea they felt that way,” he said. He was especially surprised by a lawsuit filed by a young woman whom he had treated since she was a child. She had panic attacks about going to work—she was an exotic dancer—so he prescribed Xanax for her, and, later, hydrocodone, for migraines. Then she became addicted. He’d heard that, after she got money from her lawsuit, she had trouble with the law, and ended up in jail. He added, “I thought she was a really nice girl.”\n\n\n\nSchneider said that he hadn’t experienced severe physical pain for more than a few days in his life. “Mental pain—that’s the one that bothers me now,” he told me. He said that most of his chronic-pain patients had a “chart this thick”—he held his hands a foot apart—“and, more often than not, they were bipolar.” He went on, “We probably were not diligent enough in digging into the mental part of it. We saw the physical part, but the mental part was on the edge.”\n\n\n\nI excused myself to go to the bathroom, and when I returned Schneider was staring at the ceiling with an expression of despair. He said that a guard had asked him why he agreed to the interview and told him, “You know she’s just going to tear you apart.” A few minutes later, when I asked what he would do differently if he were to start the clinic again, he seemed offended by the question. “I would have been more political,” he finally responded. “I would have been more involved in the medical community. I can’t say I ever felt like I was part of the clique.”\n\n\n\nHis sense of exclusion had heightened after his daughter, Leigh Anne, was fired from her residency. After his trial, she said that the doctors at her hospital suddenly began criticizing her work, even though she’d previously received exemplary reviews. When she applied for residencies at other Wichita hospitals, her recommendations never failed to include a sentence about her father’s prosecution. She hadn’t practiced medicine in two years. “I can’t even identify who I am now,” she told me.\n\n\n\nSchneider was struggling with his new identity, too, though some inmates still called him Doc and came to him with medical questions. The day before, he’d been approached by an inmate who had just shot up morphine, and the skin on his arm was infected. Drug use was flourishing in Atterbury’s prison, too. She wrote me, “Even here in a controlled environment, I can’t *BELIEVE*{: .small} all the narcotics being sold.” \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoons\u002F593b5dc620855957e69d52e1]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nSchneider seemed most at ease when we talked about his wife. He described their first date, on the top floor of the Holiday Inn in Wichita, repeating the jokes she had told him that night. “It was magical,” he said. For a second, his shoulders shook involuntarily. When the conversation returned to the clinic, he had trouble focussing. He seemed to feel there was something inevitable about the clinic’s trajectory, and couldn’t easily imagine how things would have unfolded differently. The clinic had offered negligent and reckless pain care, but there had been little incentive to do otherwise. He had become the kind of bad doctor that the system compensates best: he saw huge numbers of patients for brief periods of time by pleasing the customer, writing the prescriptions they desired.\n\n\n\nAll his appeals had been exhausted. In 2011, Siobhan Reynolds and one of the Schneiders’ lawyers, the one she’d been dating, died in a plane crash. The Schneiders couldn’t help wondering if this was the government’s final attempt to silence her. They both had a tendency to see conspiracy theories and cosmic connections. Last year, Atterbury was told by another prisoner, a Cambodian psychic, that they’d be released by the beginning of 2014. Atterbury prayed for verification of the message through a sign: squirrels having sex. Within two days, she saw two squirrels copulating in a tree.\n\n\n\nSchneider and Atterbury decided that when they got out they would be missionaries. Schneider missed his conviction that he was alleviating people’s suffering. He seemed torn between the belief that his patients should have the right to make their own choices about what they put into their bodies—if they asked for the pills and used them improperly, he didn’t see why he was culpable—and the sense that he was the only one who could help them. In his own way, he seemed to thrive on what he had referred to as the “Dr. God feeling.” His patients told him that he was the only doctor who understood the depth of their pain. “They gave me so much positive feedback,” he said. “It was gratifying to help those people who really needed me—people who I thought needed my help,” he said, correcting himself. “I probably needed them more than they needed me. What a humbling experience.” ♦","canonicalUrl":"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2014\u002F05\u002F05\u002Fprescription-for-disaster","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e29fd01de442c9e3e6211","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Chronic Pain","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"chronic-pain"},{"id":"5c2e1c8c2bfcc72cd92d0546","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Doctors","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"doctors"},{"id":"5c2e1e9b41c92e2c9b85dc09","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Drug Enforcement Administration (D.E.A.)","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"drug-enforcement-administration-dea"},{"id":"5c2e1ca722d4972cd5b832c6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Drugs","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"drugs"},{"id":"5c2e1ca7ee7fe02cbd163370","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Health","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"health"},{"id":"5c2e1cb44a08312cd3aa6c8b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Marriages","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"marriages"},{"id":"5c2e1ca336cecf4019214217","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Medicine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"medicine"},{"id":"5c2e1e9c81ab3335f580f35d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Narcotics","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"narcotics"},{"id":"5c2e1c7c2710c62d10815411","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Pain","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"pain"},{"id":"5c2e1ca781ab3335f580f1af","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Painkillers","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"painkillers"},{"id":"5c2e1cb54a08312cd3aa6c8f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Palliative Care","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"palliative-care"},{"id":"5c2e1ef881ab3335f580f38e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Pharmaceuticals","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"pharmaceuticals"},{"id":"5c2e1dc72396212cbb9fcac6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Pills","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"pills"},{"id":"5c2e1d642bc86f2c9a244a9c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Trials","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"trials"}],"sections":[{"id":"591bb981ccc2bd451f5eb40e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Letter from Wichita","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"letter-from-wichita"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a84bdf652b705f4a7554","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Rachel Aviv joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2013\\.

Battalion, on Staten Island, is the best person in New York City. During his twenty-four years on the job, he has saved many lives—“hundreds, probably,” he says. D’Agosto is known throughout the department as an instructor in emergency medical techniques. When I went looking for him the other day at battalion headquarters, near the southern end of the island, one of his colleagues said he was out, called him on the phone, and told me an address where I could find him. Somehow I had the impression that D’Agosto would be conducting an instructional session, but he turned out to be getting a tattoo of an owl (“for wisdom”) on his left forearm at Contemporary Tattoo and Gallery, occasional workplace of his friend and E.M.S. colleague Josh Fitch, who was washing down D’Agosto’s arm for stencilling when I came in.\n\n\n\n\n\nStaten Island has a lot of tattoo parlors, Italian delicatessens, two-story office buildings with empty spaces to rent, massage therapists, car services, Italian restaurants, places that give rock-music lessons and host children’s birthday parties, laundromats, liquor stores, tire shops, nail parlors, foot spas, pet-grooming salons, hair salons, barbershops (“buzz cuts, fades, tape-ups”). A small-business miscellany, sprung from the borough’s abundant middle-class life, lines the bigger roads like Hylan Boulevard from one end of the island to the other.\n\n\n\nMost Staten Island enterprises are as their signs describe them. Occasionally, one or two storefronts that look no different from the rest also do a steady, word-of-mouth business in the illegal sale of OxyContin, oxycodone, Percocet, and other prescription painkillers. A neighborhood ice-cream truck playing its jingle might also be selling pills, according to police, who keep an eye on ice-cream trucks. A window-blinds and drapery store sold oxycodone pills until the N.Y.P.D. arrested one of the owners and the store closed. At a barbershop called Beyond Styles, on Giffords Lane, in the Great Kills neighborhood, police arrested the owner and two accomplices in October of 2013 for selling oxycodone and other drugs—two thousand pills a week, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\n\n\nThe silent sniper fire of overdoses from pills and heroin that has been picking people off one at a time in increasing numbers all over the country for almost twenty years has hit Staten Island harder than anyplace else in the city. For a number of reasons, this borough of four hundred and seventy thousand-plus people offers unusually good entry routes for the opioid epidemic. In 2012, thirty-six people on Staten Island overdosed on heroin and thirty-seven on prescription opioid pills, for an average of almost exactly one overdose death every five days. Many of the dead have been young people in their late teens to early thirties. In this self-contained place, everybody seems to know everybody, and the grief as the deaths accumulate has been frantic and terrified.\n\n\n\nI wanted to talk to Joseph D’Agosto because he had recently appeared in the Staten Island _Advance_ for saving an overdose victim. That alone would not have got him in the news, because he saves overdose victims with some frequency. What made this rescue different was that he used a nasal-spray syringe of a drug known as Narcan, whose name comes from the first syllables of “narcotic antagonist,” a term for opioids that reverse the action of other opioids. In Narcan, the antagonist drug is an opioid called naloxone. Like heroin, naloxone is highly soluble in the blood, and it acts almost instantly, reversing the effects of heroin or pain-relief opioid pills often in one or two minutes. Formerly, D’Agosto and other paramedics administered an intravenous dosage of naloxone to revive overdose victims; general use of the nasal-spray injector is something new. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F593b5c9d3adc75471b34afd1]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nJosh Fitch traced the outline of the owl tattoo on D’Agosto’s arm, which D’Agosto extended as if getting an I.V. himself. “We received a call for an unresponsive person in the courtyard of an apartment building, early morning, around three or four o’clock, on a night shift last February,” D’Agosto told me. “The unresponsive person, a lady in her sixties, was slumped over on a bench, in like a robe or a housecoat. Near her we found a pill bottle for painkillers, almost empty, and I saw on the label that it had been filled only a week before. She was not breathing, lips blue, pupils miotic—pinpoint-size—all symptoms of opioid O.D. We put her head back, secured a breathing passage. I took the Narcan injector and sprayed a milligram of the naloxone solution in each nostril, and about a minute later she coughed and started breathing again. My partner that night, Henry Cordero, and I were, like, ‘O.K.! We figured it out!’ We put her on the stretcher and brought her to the hospital, and they took over from there.\n\n\n\n“In the past, when we used the naloxone with the I.V., that worked, too, of course. But finding a vein for the I.V. can be difficult. Maybe the person was an I.V. drug user and he’s got collapsed veins in his arms. Maybe you’re in a dim hallway, family members around you crying and screaming—there it’s not as easy finding a vein as in a well-lit hospital room. Also, you have the problem of when they come to, sometimes they get agitated and want to fight you, and with the I.V. there can be a danger of a needle stick from someone who may have a disease. With the Narcan atomizer, none of that is a problem, and anybody can use it. You don’t need a special skill—you just spray it in the nose. And everybody’s got a nose.”\n\n\n\nThe Narcan nasal-spray program began in Staten Island’s 120th Precinct in January. All first responders—police and firefighters, along with the E.M.T.s—received Narcan syringes and instruction on how to use them. Including the police was important, because they usually get to the scene first, and speed counts; when an overdose victim stops breathing, brain damage begins in four to six minutes and death soon follows. By March, responders with Narcan had saved three overdose victims in the precinct. City higher-ups decided to extend the program to the rest of the borough and, soon afterward, to the rest of the city. More Narcan-produced rescues followed. In June, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the Narcan kits would be given to every first-responder unit in the state.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIt used to be that the medical profession undertreated pain. Doctors didn’t want to create opioid addicts, and the consensus was that patients should suffer rather than risk addiction. That started to change in the seventies, with the rise of the pain-management movement, when pain came to be seen not only as a symptom but as an illness in itself. Now the worry was of “opiophobia.” A widely used pharmaceuticals textbook advised, “Although many physicians are concerned about ‘creating addicts,’ very few individuals begin their drug addiction problems by misuse of prescription drugs. . . . Fear of producing such medical addicts results in needless suffering among patients with pain.”\n\n\n\n\n\nStrong opioids like morphine or oxycodone already existed for patients with intense, short-term pain from healing trauma or end-of-life illnesses. Long-term, chronic pain was another matter—no existing drug was ideal for that. Seeing the need, Purdue Frederick, a pharmaceutical company in Norwalk, Connecticut, developed a long-term pain reliever called MS Contin, which was a morphine pill with a time-release formula. When the patent ran out on MS Contin, Purdue introduced a time-release oxycodone pill, OxyContin.\n\n\n\nThe pill entered the market in 1996 and quickly became an iatrogenic disaster. OxyContin’s purpose was merciful—to provide pain relief at a steady rate over a ten- or twelve-hour period, so a pain sufferer could sleep—and millions benefitted from taking it. But for its effect to last that long the pill had to contain a lot of oxycodone. People discovered that the capsules could be crushed, then swallowed, snorted, or injected for a powerful high. Purdue marketed the drug aggressively to general practitioners who accepted the company’s claim (untested and untrue) that OxyContin was difficult to abuse. Overdoses involving OxyContin soon became horribly routine in places like Maine and West Virginia. As the epidemic of “Oxy” addiction and overdose spread, Purdue did not take the drug off the market. Several states and many individuals sued the company, which fought with tobacco-company-like determination but eventually gave in. In 2007, Purdue pleaded guilty in federal court to misbranding the drug by not stating its potential for causing addiction—a felony—and paid a fine that totalled $634.5 million. It also introduced a version of OxyContin that was more tamper-proof. By that time, the drug had made the company many billions of dollars. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F593b5c9e0f529324ac062856]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nEven with the fines and the deaths, OxyContin showed the profitability of long-term opioid pain relievers and contributed to the enormous proliferation of pain pills nationwide. Therein lay the beginning of Staten Island’s opioid problem. More Staten Islanders work in health care than in any other industry. Health-care workers often know about and have access to pills, and their insurance generally pays for them. Many other Staten Islanders are police officers, firefighters, and sanitation workers, with health insurance from the city. If they get injured on the job, they see their own doctors, who can write prescriptions. Staten Islanders receive the pills, in short, because they are prescribed them and can afford them. In 2012, doctors and hospitals on Staten Island prescribed painkillers at a rate about twice that of the rest of the city.\n\n\n\nKids who abuse pills usually get them first from friends or the family medicine cabinet, but then they have to buy them. Illegal pills sell for as much as forty or fifty dollars apiece. Six or eight dollars, however, will buy a packet of heroin, for a high that’s the same or better. Most people who come to heroin get there by way of pills. New York City is the heroin capital of the country; twenty per cent of all the heroin confiscations and arrests nationwide happen here. When I talked to Agent James J. Hunt, the head of the New York Division of the D.E.A., he said that ninety per cent of New York’s heroin originates in South America and Mexico. Poppy fields in Colombia grow the raw opium, labs hidden in the jungle process it, Mexican drug cartels smuggle the heroin through the Caribbean or across the U.S.-Mexico border, and dealers, who are often Dominicans, package it, stamp it with brand names like Breaking Bad or Government Shutdown, and sell it to street dealers. Heroin confiscations at the border have increased from about five hundred and fifty-six kilos in 2008 to about twenty-one hundred kilos in 2012. In New York in 2014, more than two hundred kilos had been seized by July, more than twice as much as during all of 2013.\n\n\n\nAgent Hunt’s office chair at his big desk in D.E.A. headquarters in Manhattan is black and high-backed. He wore a black shirt and a muted tie. His blue eyes and his blond, wavy hair parted almost in the middle made his face stand out as if in an Old Master dark-background oil portrait. I asked if the plan to push large quantities of cheap heroin and undersell the illegal pill market had been the idea of a particular person—like El Chapo Guzmán (the Sinaloan cartel leader who went to jail, escaped, and was recently recaptured). Hunt thought a minute and said, “Yes, it probably was his idea, or the idea of four or five cartel leaders like him.\n\n\n\n“In Yonkers recently there were some dealers who were mixing heroin with fentanyl, a very dangerous opioid, and selling it on the street,” Hunt went on. “Four people died from using it, and the dealers kept on selling it even after they knew that. Anybody who would sell heroin is evil.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe opioid epidemic may seem to be a crisis that simply happened, but actual people set it in motion, and other actual people make it worse and keep it going. The cartel leaders and the smugglers and the dealers belong to the second category. In the first category must be included the former management of Purdue Pharma, three of whom pleaded guilty to a non-felony misbranding charge. Purdue Pharma is the huge drug company that grew from Purdue Frederick, whose owners, Dr. Mortimer Sackler and Dr. Raymond Sackler, were not charged in the case. Their older brother and mentor, Dr. Arthur Sackler, known as the founder of modern pharmaceutical advertising, served as the inspiration for the company’s ambitious OxyContin marketing strategy. The Sacklers made many philanthropic gifts and many things are named after them, such as the Sackler Wing, at New York City’s Metropolitan Museum, with its famous Temple of Dendur.\n\n\n\n\n\nStaten Island’s special misfortune is to exist at a point where somewhat ambiguous but real corporate crime helped to provide a market opportunity for straight-ahead drug-cartel crime. In the years since Purdue Pharma pleaded guilty, the company has tried to make its product safer and to draw more attention to problems of abuse. During the early years of the OxyContin rollout, it has to be said, Purdue ignored the physician’s basic rule, _Primum non nocere_—“First, do no harm”—with terrible consequences.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nJohnathan Charles Crupi is buried in Triangle 63, Lot 66, Grave 3, in Staten Island’s Ocean View Cemetery. He died in March, at the age of twenty-one. A photograph of him—blue eyes, affectionate smile, gold-colored earring in one ear—looks at you from his marker. The grave is still fresh, the dirt reddish, next to a gravel lane that wanders by. Purple and white impatiens, a pot of campanula, and a circle of white stones brighten the plot. The ocean is difficult to see from the cemetery and impossible to hear. The main sounds are birdsong, a lawnmower, and the nearby buzzing of a Weedwacker.\n\n \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F593b5ca03adc75471b34afd5]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nJohnathan Crupi’s parents, Barry and Candace Crupi, did not want his obituary in the _Advance_ to say he “died at home”—a newspaper formula sometimes used for overdose victims. The writeup described him as a “wonderful kid until drugs came” and said he died of a heroin overdose.\n\n\n\nIn May, the Crupis took part in a New York State Senate Joint Task Force Panel Discussion on Heroin and Opioid Addiction at a community center near the middle of the island. The gathering was one of many held by the New York State Legislature to get public comments on the problem at various locations around the state—the Senate held eighteen such forums, the Assembly held three. For this event, the room, a high-ceilinged conference space, seated a hundred and fifty or more, with many standees along the side. Before the proceedings started, a chatty, neighborly cheeriness overlay the nerve-racked, sometimes desperate mood underneath.\n\n\n\nAll stood for the Pledge of Allegiance. A state senator, the task force’s head, spoke, followed by other senators. Then Brian Hunt, a panelist identified in the program as “Father of deceased Adam Hunt,” stood up. (He and Agent James Hunt are not related.) Brian Hunt’s voice was in a register almost beyond pain. He said that Adam had been in rehab for two months and came home to look for a job. In February, at a Super Bowl party, he took a drink. Soon afterward, someone sold him heroin. He died on March 2nd of acute heroin intoxication. Some of the people he had bought drugs from, as Hunt later learned, lived in the Hunts’ neighborhood, on the next block. Sellers of heroin hide in plain sight and may be friends and neighbors; sellers of heroin should get life in prison, he said.\n\n\n\nCandace Crupi spoke next. Her voice was small, quiet, and almost devoid of intonation. She talked about a time when Johnathan was four and she lost him briefly at a Costco. She said what a sweet boy he was. She said no one was ever beyond redemption, because “every angel has a past and every sinner has a future.” She added that the pharmaceutical companies should help pay for drug treatment, because they’re reaping all the profits and suffering none of the sorrow.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nSeveral young men who stood up at the meeting said they were addicts in recovery and praised a rehab program called Dynamite, in Brooklyn. When I called Dynamite’s number, its executive director, Bill Fusco, and associate director, Karen Carlini, offered to show me around. Dynamite is the short name for Dynamic Youth Community, a rehab program with residential facilities in the town of Fallsburg, upstate, and outpatient services and main offices on Coney Island Avenue, in a distant neighborhood of Brooklyn.\n\n\n\n\n\nFusco, who co-founded D.Y.C. more than forty years ago, has the heft and the large hands of a blazing-fast softball pitcher, which he is. Karen Carlini, who’s slim and pretty, began as a patient and then a volunteer at the center, in the seventies. D.Y.C. is for young people between the ages of sixteen and twenty-four. The program begins with a year’s residence at Fallsburg and continues with a year of daily outpatient attendance at the Brooklyn center. At the moment, seventy-five members—“They’re not clients or patients, they’re members of the Dynamite family,” Fusco said—were here on outpatient status, with an almost equal number in residence at Fallsburg. Seventy-eight per cent had entered the program because of addiction to heroin.\n\n\n\nFusco and Carlini and another staffer and I sat and talked with a group of members in a circle in a high-windowed top-floor room with easy chairs and couches. Some of the young women got comfortable with their legs folded under them, as the incoming daylight of sobriety set the atmosphere. There was a moment of everybody looking at one another. A lot could go unsaid—how they got here, the nightmares that went before. Every sentence carried a freight of experience and accomplishment. They had built houses at Fallsburg, and gone without cell phones or Internet, and visited the county fair, and attended religious services in the town, and written letters, and hiked to the waterfall on the property, and played softball, and painted the scenery for the graduation ceremony, and sat on the lawn, and, as one young woman said, “learned how to have sober fun again.”\n\n\n\nThey all said that they had thought pills couldn’t be so bad, because doctors were prescribing them. “I never thought they could create an addict in me,” one said. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F593b5ca257b86d47b169c08f]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nFusco repeated that they had worked hard to get where they are today and they should be proud, because they did the hardest parts themselves. Later, he told me that the program costs about twenty-eight thousand dollars a year per member. Parents pay a portion, on a sliding scale depending on income, and New York State picks up most of the rest. “I think the taxpayers are justified in expecting that the state will contribute when their kids need this kind of help and the health insurance won’t cover it,” he said.\n\n\n\n“Up to now, insurance has allowed for only seven or ten days of rehab, twenty-eight days at most,” Carlini said. “That might work for adults who have families to support and a limited amount of time. But for kids who are addicted rehab takes years, not weeks. The good news is that kids are more resilient than older people. They can recover fully, both physically and mentally.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nSome of the Dynamite members said that at one time or another they had overdosed and naloxone had revived them. To a few this had happened more than once. Though the drug may have saved their lives, none said they enjoyed the experience. Naloxone is like the bouncer of the opioids; it stops the high of heroin or morphine or opioid pills so fast that the user does a hundred-and-eighty-degree return to reality and undergoes the familiar miseries of detoxing in a sudden, intense onset. The reversal is of short duration, though, and after thirty to ninety minutes the person usually slips back into a milder opioid sleep. If the original opioid was in the system in such an amount as still to be a threat, the naloxone must be used again. Most overdoses involve multiple drugs; naloxone works only on other opioids. Alcohol, cocaine, and benzodiazepines like Valium are unaffected by it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a minor asterisk, one can say that naloxone was invented in Queens. (A Japanese pharmaceutical company received an earlier patent for the drug, but seems not to have known what it had.) Dr. Jack Fishman, a young biochemist with a Ph.D. from Wayne State University, first developed it in a small lab under the elevated tracks on Jamaica Avenue in the late nineteen-fifties. Ever since morphine was synthesized from opium, in 1803, chemists had been searching for a drug with morphine’s good qualities but none of its bad. Mostly what they’d come up with was other addictive drugs—heroin, for example, invented by an English chemist in 1874 and developed commercially by Germany’s Bayer Company as a cough suppressant aimed mainly at patients with pneumonia and terminal TB. Opioids with antagonistic properties had been discovered before naloxone, but they presented serious problems. Nalorphine and cyclazocine both reversed the effects of pain-relieving opioids but also caused severe dysphoria (the opposite of euphoria), hallucinations, and psychotic episodes.\n\n\n\nDr. Fishman worked at the Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research and had taken a second job at the private lab in Queens because he was going through a divorce and needed the money. Dr. Mozes Lewenstein, the head of narcotics research at a company called Endo Laboratories, oversaw the private lab. A colleague of his at Endo, Dr. Harold Blumberg, proposed that a change in the structure of oxymorphone, a recently synthesized morphine derivative ten times as strong as morphine, might produce an opioid antagonist of comparable potency. Following Blumberg’s idea, Fishman began to work with oxymorphone and, by replacing an N-methyl group in its structure with an allyl group, synthesized naloxone. Tests showed it to be more potent at reversing the effects of opioids than any antagonist synthesized so far. In 1961, Lewenstein and Fishman applied for a U.S. patent for naloxone, called only by its chemical name, N-allyl-14-hydroxydihydro-nor-morphinone. Five years later, they received patent 3,254,088.\n\n\n\nThe drug turned out to have all kinds of uses. First, as an opioid antidote, naloxone comes with almost no contraindications—it does not combine to bad effect with other drugs. Its serious side effects are rare and few. (A study found that in 1.3 per cent of cases where naloxone was administered, seizures and pulmonary edema occurred.) Though naloxone displaces other opioids, no other opioids displace it. During the period before it wears off, it has the final word. It produces no analgesic effects and is itself non-addictive. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F593b5ca51260cf20873dfc82]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nNaloxone’s invention led to important discoveries about the chemistry of the brain and the nervous system, such as the discovery of endorphins. These endogenous opioid peptides—chemicals in the body that provide pain relief and pleasure like pain-relieving opioids—revealed hints of their existence when it was found that electronically stimulated pain relief could be reversed by naloxone. If naloxone could reverse pain relief when no drugs were present, researchers guessed that the body must have its own pain-relief systems. “Endorphin,” the word, comes from “endogenous morphine.” A number of such natural chemicals were later found, along with receptors in the brain upon which they and the opioids acted. Other studies showed that naloxone may block the pain-relieving effects of acupuncture and placebos, temporarily suppress the urge to eat, and reduce the body’s shock and stress reactions.\n\n\n\nThe drug must be injected or administered intranasally, because it’s not absorbed well by digestion. This is fortunate for drugmakers who want to put safety brakes on drugs meant to be taken only orally. Suboxone, a methadone-like drug used in the treatment of addiction, consists of naloxone combined with an analgesic opioid called buprenorphine. The Suboxone pill releases its buprenorphine under the tongue, but if you try to grind up the pill and inject it for a stronger rush naloxone’s usual downer effect kicks in.\n\n\n\nNaloxone is given to newborns whose mothers have had opioid painkillers during childbirth, so the opioid won’t suppress the babies’ breathing. Postoperative patients sometimes are brought out of anesthetic with naloxone. Patients suffering from dissociative disorder, which often causes everything around them to seem unreal, can be treated with naloxone; the drug’s true affinity seems to be with reality. Naloxone has no dysphoric or psychotomimetic effects and no obvious potential for abuse. Anybody can use it to revive an overdose victim with little fear of causing injury. Thebaine, the Tasmania-grown, opium-derived raw-material precursor of oxycodone and other legal opioids, is also the precursor of naloxone; the harmless drug comes from the same stuff as the dangerous ones for which it is the antidote. If there ever was a _primum non nocere_ drug, naloxone is it.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nOur Lady Star of the Sea, a Catholic church serving forty-one hundred families, occupies a rise above Amboy Road, in the Huguenot neighborhood. Weekly, the church offers fourteen Masses and a dozen twelve-step-program meetings—seven of Alcoholics Anonymous, two of Pills Anonymous, and one each of Gamblers Anonymous, Adult Children of Alcoholics, and Al-Anon. Cars come and go in the ample parking lot all day. Some guys were leaving an A.A. meeting at the rectory and having an earnest conversation as I went in one afternoon to see Monsignor Jeffrey P. Conway, at that time Our Lady Star of the Sea’s pastor (he has since moved to St. Patrick’s, in nearby Richmondtown). Conway is a tall, narrow-faced, soft-spoken, cerebral man who even in civilian clothes looks set apart. The blue polo shirt, blue slacks, and blue sneakers he was wearing somehow evoked monastic garb.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe had been pastor at this church since 1993 and had watched the opioid problem grow in the area, he said. As an A.A. member himself for thirty-five years—in a kind of apostolic succession from one of A.A.’s founders, Bob Smith, whose nephew was the doctor at a rehab clinic for priests that he attended in Michigan—Conway instituted the church’s various addiction programs. In 2010, two young brothers said they wanted to start a chapter of Pills Anonymous here. Only about five people came to the first meetings, but fifty or sixty attend regularly now.\n\n\n\nAn assistant brought him a black-bound ledger with “Deaths” on its front cover in gold Gothic letters, and he began to turn its pages slowly. “I wanted to look at this. I’ve presided at a lot of funerals for overdose victims,” he said. “Here’s one . . . March 9, 2011. . . . He was eighteen years old. . . . Another, April 10, 2011 . . . twenty-two years old. I remember he joined A.A. as a sixteen-year-old, and later stopped coming to meetings. I heard he was doing pills and I tried to get in touch with him but he wouldn’t take my calls. . . . May of 2012 . . . He was thirty-one. His family said it wasn’t drugs, but I’m not sure of it. . . . It’s hard to know what to say in your funeral homily, almost impossible to give consolation. The families feel guilty, bereaved, angry at the kid, angry at themselves. . . . Here’s a fifteen-year-old boy. . . . A young woman, May of ’13 . . . And here, June of ’13 . . .This young man was in rehab in Georgia and got out and was found dead a few days later in a motel room. . . . Another, November 13th, end of last year . . . twenty-three years old.” \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F593b5ca73adc75471b34afdf]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nHe laid the book aside. I asked if Scripture has any verses that apply to this situation. “Second Corinthians, Chapter 12,” he said, and then he recited, “ ‘In order that I might not become conceited by the abundance of revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to harass me, to keep me from being too elated. . . . The Lord said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” I will all the more gladly boast of my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. . . . For when I am weak, then I am strong.’\n\n\n\n“That’s the twelve-step idea of admitting your weakness in the face of addiction and giving yourself up to a higher power,” he continued. “Alcoholism takes a while to ruin your life, but opioid addiction can happen in a week. It’s almost instant. And the physical addiction of opioids is much harder to fight. Once you’re off the drugs, you still have to maintain your sobriety by going to twelve-step meetings. The programs that get kids off drugs are wonderful, but some don’t emphasize the follow-up enough. At meetings, you have the fellowship of older participants who know about sobriety day to day and year to year. Stopping drugs is the beginning. Then you must keep getting the power in order to stay stopped.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nI wandered all over Staten Island but saw very few outward signs of the opioid crisis. On July 8th, police arrested a pharmacist named Anthony D’Alessandro at his house in a new development for stealing almost two hundred thousand oxycodone pills while he was head of the drug dispensary at Manhattan’s Beth Israel Medical Center (he pleaded not guilty); when I walked through his neighborhood soon afterward, it seemed untouched, with kids playing baseball in a little park and women watering yards. In the pharmacist’s front window was a vase with a bouquet of pussy willows.\n\n\n\n\n\nI checked behind a high school, where a footpath rumored to be a drug hangout dozed, empty of hangers-out, in the suburban fragrance of newly mown grass. By a shopping-center alley in which drug deals supposedly occur, a young man in a yarmulke was handing out campaign literature to passing shoppers. At a park entrance where, according to police, an undercover cop bought four oxycodone pills for thirty dollars each from a young woman drug dealer, an Uncle Louie G’s Italian Ices truck was playing “I Can’t Stop Loving You,” “The Battle Hymn of the Republic,” and “O Come, All Ye Faithful.”\n\n\n\nAs I drove by Silver Mount Cemetery, on Victory Boulevard, suddenly a shirtless young man with tousled blond hair and wild eyes was walking toward me in my lane. I veered. His face was weirdly red and he held a clear plastic water bottle in one hand. By the time I pulled over and looked back for him, he was gone.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe plague’s silence and invisibility on Staten Island kept it from public attention for a long while. Deaths from overdose do not tend to happen on the street. As a veteran rehab counsellor said at the Senate Joint Task Force meeting, “The kids would come home by curfew, say good night to their parents, and leave their bedrooms feet first the next morning.” Then commuters started noticing kids nodding out on the ferry and on the Staten Island Railway. Neighbors heard from neighbors about kids who had overdosed, and the bad news spread. Daniel Master, the Chief Assistant District Attorney of Richmond County (Staten Island’s coextensive county), remembers going to a wake for an older person and observing that the other part of the funeral home was filled with weeping teen-agers.\n\n\n\n\n\nStaten Island is not the healthiest place. It has the highest rate of smoking in the city and shares the highest rate of obesity with the Bronx. More teen-agers here, per capita, use alcohol and binge-drink than in the other boroughs. “Kids drinking is just a part of the culture here,” explained Diane Arneth, the president and C.E.O. of a nonprofit called Community Health Action of Staten Island (*CHASI*{: .small}). “Staten Island is a mostly blue-collar community, and drinking on the weekend is a normal way to relax. When kids are around, sometimes they drink, too. The parents say they’d rather have the kids drinking at home than out somewhere on the street. I know people who play drinking games with their underage kids and their kids’ friends at family parties. It’s not seen as a big deal. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F593b5cb51260cf20873dfc97]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\n“Staten Islanders generally work in other parts of the city, and they have the longest average commuting times in the United States,” Arneth went on. “So the kids are alone a lot. The parents accept that, because this is a supposedly ‘safe’ place. Staten Island kids have cars, they use social media, they’re mobile, looking for the party. Pills fit right into that world. And then, when substance-abuse problems come up that the parents can’t handle, they hate to ask for help. A lot of them are cops, firemen, they’ve done military service. They give help, they’re not used to asking for it. Help is for ‘those people’—families in the projects, Latino immigrants, poor people—not for them. When we went to community boards back in the nineties trying to set up local needle exchanges to stop the spread of *AIDS*{: .small}, some of the responses were so cruel. Nobody thought it was their problem. They said, ‘They’re just junkies—let them die.’ Now some of the same people who used to yell at me about why I cared about the junkies are asking for help for their addicted kids.”\n\n\n\nCommunity Health Action of Staten Island works closely with a larger nonprofit called the Staten Island Partnership for Community Wellness, which in 2011 responded to the youth opioid problem by founding a coalition called Tackling Youth Substance Abuse. *TYSA’*{: .small}s enterprising director, Adrienne Abbate, brought together many groups and agencies to look for solutions, and the idea of giving Narcan kits to all emergency personnel came from one of *tysa*{: .small}’s meetings in 2013.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIf you want a Narcan kit of your own, Community Health Action of Staten Island will provide you with one at no charge. You have to attend a training session at a *CHASI*{: .small} office, where you watch a PowerPoint presentation, hear some facts (drug overdoses recently overtook car accidents as the leading cause of accidental death in the United States; most victims of drug overdose are between the ages of thirty-five and fifty-four), answer questionnaires having to do with your knowledge of opioids, and do a hands-on assembly of syringes from kits that are past their expiration dates. You leave with a small blue nylon zip-up bag that contains a prescription for the drug signed by a doctor or a nurse practitioner, two syringes and two capsules in small cardboard boxes that say “Naloxone Hydrochloride” on them, two “Intranasal Mucosal Atomization Devices” that fit onto the syringes, a pair of rubber gloves, two alcohol wipes, and a mouth-to-mouth-resuscitation face shield.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoshua Sippen, a vice-president of *CHASI*{: .small}, led the session that I attended. Before he began, he pointed me out and said I was a reporter, in case anyone in the group objected on the ground of privacy; a number of the attendees were the mothers of addicts. Nobody did. Afterward, a woman named Melissa Forsyth, who had been sitting a few rows up, introduced herself to me as Missy. I was glad to meet her. She has a good laugh—the kind that’s full-throated and infectious, an intact survival from a younger self. She said her son had been addicted to heroin. Like others there, she wanted the naloxone kit in case she ever had to save her child. Data show that as many as eighty-five per cent of overdose victims are with other people at the time of the overdose; if there’s naloxone in the vicinity and someone to administer it, they could be saved.\n\n\n\nA few days later, she and I met at a bagel place on Bay Street. She was on a break from her job as a Y.M.C.A. peer counsellor working with families of addicts, she had a four-month-old girl she was taking care of in a stroller, she was getting lunch for herself and her seventeen-year-old daughter, Leanne, and her phone kept ringing. Missy Forsyth is forty-six years old. Her husband, a New York City firefighter, is forty-seven. Her brown hair was pulled back in a clip, and she wore a patterned top and a pair of rectangular glasses, lightly tinted purple.\n\n\n\n“My addict is my oldest son, Joe,” she told me, jiggling the baby on a knee. “He had a horrible experience—his cousin Amanda, who he was close to, was hit by a car and killed on Richmond Avenue coming out of a Sweet Sixteen party in 2006, and he blamed himself. He was supposed to come home and take care of his younger siblings so his father could pick her up. Of course, the accident was not his fault, but he started drinking heavily, then doing pills, and eventually he went to heroin. We understood how bad it was when we found he’d been taking money out of a family member’s bank account.”\n\n\n\nShe answered a phone call, got a bottle of water for the baby, and told her daughter what sandwich she wanted. “Joe says he’s clean now,” she said. “He’s been in three rehab programs. I hope that’s finally true. But, really, it never ends. He went to college at Oneonta, left after a year. Worked at a café, got a job as an exterminator, went to College of Staten Island, dropped out. Did a year of treatment at a residential rehab, came back, started working at a brand-new hotel in Brooklyn, lost that job. Now he lives with his fiancée. The disease is hard to fight, and he kept getting sucked back in. I support him when he’s in recovery, at arm’s length when he’s not.” \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F593b5cb720855957e69d51e5]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nA young woman she knew came in and stopped to talk to her. (People in Staten Island seem constantly to run into friends and acquaintances when they go out.) “I used to try to control what my kids do, but I’ve stopped that,” she said, turning back to me. “I was a helicopter parent, but my helicopter landed long ago. Now I’m working on a certification in counselling at C.S.I., I volunteer for the Y.M.C.A., and I do presentations at schools about drug addiction. I want to give people a face they can put with the addiction crisis. I was very involved with my kids’ lives, coached their sports teams, drove them to lessons, and still this happened to us. I tell the high-school kids again and again that opioid pills can make them addicts in five days. I say, ‘Don’t drink, but if you do, whatever you do, *DO NOT*{: .small} take any pill. Stick to alcohol!’ ” She laughed; she was kidding about the last part.\n\n\n\n“Joe is a loose, tall, gangly sort of kid,” she said after a moment, readjusting the baby in her arms. “As a little boy and a teen-ager, he was always kind of flopping around and tripping and falling down, and then he’d get right up again and be fine. It’s a reality I’ve accepted in my life that Joe may one day be dead. But so far he’s still alive. As long as he’s still breathing, I’ve got hope.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn 2012, New York State passed a law called *ISTOP\u002F*{: .small}P.M.P., for Internet System for Tracking Over-Prescribing\u002FPrescription Monitoring Program, and it went into effect in August, 2013. *ISTOP*{: .small} requires that most prescribers of painkillers and other drugs with the potential for abuse check the state’s Prescription Monitoring Program to see what the patient’s prescription history has been during the previous six months before giving out a prescription. The idea is to make it difficult for people to go to a series of doctors and get repeats.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin a few months, evidence seemed to show that *ISTOP*{: .small} had reduced the amount of illegal opioids on the market. Critics said the law would create a greater demand for heroin, and that seemed to have occurred. According to N.Y.P.D. Captain Dominick D’Orazio, commanding officer of Staten Island Narcotics, seizures of pills had gone down forty-four per cent, while seizures of heroin had gone up by the same amount. D’Orazio said he saw this as a good sign for the long run, because virtually everybody who tries heroin nowadays begins as an opioid pill abuser; fewer pills out there may mean fewer heroin addicts in the future.\n\n\n\nDiane Arneth took a similarly positive view of what sensible laws and public-health policy can accomplish. She noted that *AIDS*{: .small} needle-exchange programs, which met resistance not only in Staten Island but all over the country, reduced the number of needle-transmitted *AIDS*{: .small} cases in New York from fifty per cent in 1992 to four per cent today. Programs that are now handing out naloxone kits in Chicago and San Francisco and other cities started, like her own *CHASI*{: .small}, as providers of *AIDS*{: .small} services and needle exchanges. Reducing overdose deaths will be their next victory, she believes.\n\n\n\nAn August 28th press release from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene announced that the citywide rates of drug-overdose deaths had gone up forty-one per cent between 2010 and 2013. Now the city’s average for such deaths is two a day. The Staten Island overdose death rate, however, is starting to come down after its fourfold increase between 2005 and 2011. The department said that the aggressive approach to Staten Island’s overdose crisis would now be applied elsewhere in the city.\n\n\n\nOn Staten Island, the new Narcan program had resulted in thirteen overdose reversals by July, adding to the thousands naloxone has already rescued nationwide. Dr. Jack Fishman could be proud. When he invented naloxone, he was only in his twenties; I wondered if he might still be alive, and what he thought of his invention now. It turned out that he died in December, 2013, but his oldest son, Howard, lives on the Upper West Side. Howard remembered the storefront lab, the El tracks overhead, the smell of chemicals, and the drugstore next door where his father used to buy him a pistachio ice-cream cone after his visits. After his father and his father’s parents escaped from Poland, in the thirties, they were penniless, Howard told me. His father’s pharmaceutical discoveries and career eventually made his fortune. He did important work on breast cancer, headed a pharmaceutical company, served as a consultant to the World Health Organization, and was director of research at the Strang-Cornell Institute for Cancer Research until shortly before his death.\n\n\n\nI asked Howard if his father took satisfaction from the fact that his invention had saved so many lives. “He was a complicated man,” Howard said. “Like many super-achievers, he thought he had never really achieved anything. He shied away from the spotlight. He didn’t talk about himself; he talked about other people—like when he met Kissinger, he talked about that. Originally, he had wanted to be a rabbi. He was very generous to his family members around the world. He was a good father. I’m happy just to bask in his glow. His was a well-lived life.” \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: \u002Fcartoon\u002F593b5cb857b86d47b169c0a3]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nA woman whom naloxone revived more than a decade ago, when she was in her twenties, now works for a national nonprofit that fights drug addiction and its dysfunctions. She is married, with two small children, and her official, job-related manner is bright and hopeful. When I asked her what being revived by naloxone had felt like, she hesitated. Her voice changed; a particular quiet bleakness filled it. “When I overdosed, I was with some other people, and one of them had a naloxone injector kit he had bought from his dealer,” she said. “I guess this dealer was kind of conscientious, if that doesn’t sound too strange. Maybe he wanted his clients to be safe, so he wouldn’t be hit with drug-induced-homicide charges. Anyway, he sold naloxone kits sometimes. Back then, there were no naloxone distribution programs where we were.\n\n\n\n\n\n“So we did heroin, and I overdosed, and the guy with the naloxone injected me with it, and all I remember is waking up and feeling so horrible that I thought the people I was with were being mean to me. I didn’t thank anybody for saving me—I was only angry and upset that they had made me feel like this. The withdrawal came on immediately and it was very, very painful, like twenty times worse than the worst flu I ever had. But without the naloxone I don’t know what would have happened. The thought of being left passed out where I was still scares me. We were homeless junkies. Nobody who saw me would have bothered with me. No way anybody would’ve called 911.”\n\n\n\nShe talked about her recovery and what it still involves. I asked her what she imagined would be the best possible result of the work she’s doing, and she said, “I love that question!” Her voice brightened completely. “We’re going to stop this opioid pandemic!” she said, and began to explain how. ♦","canonicalUrl":"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.newyorker.com\u002Fmagazine\u002F2014\u002F09\u002F08\u002Fantidote","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59110cbe5603f521f279510b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Local Correspondents","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-local-correspondents"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a0de4c14b3c606c109f7f","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Ian Frazier is a staff writer at _The New Yorker_.
